DSI000000,Serenoa repens,C4082853,"Saw palmetto is a dwarf palm that grows in the coastal lands of North America, West Indies, and Mediterranean countries. The fruits are a rich source of fatty acids and phytosterols and have been used to promote urination, reduce inflammation, and for treatment of conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).Various heterogeneous extracts of saw palmetto are available, but many basic research and clinical trials used a hexanic extract of S. repens, which has anti-inflammatory, anti-androgenic, and antiproliferative activities . Whereas some data indicate that saw palmetto extracts improve lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in both male and female patients with BPH, conflicting data suggest no such effects . In another large study, a saw palmetto extract did not affect serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) more than placebo even at high doses . But pretreatment with saw palmetto reduced intra- and postoperative complications in patients who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate and open prostatectomy , and reduced prostatic inflammation . Data also suggest benefits against chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome . A saw palmetto extract was found to inhibit growth of normal prostate cells and increase their sensitivity to radiation in vitro, but did not affect malignant prostate cancer cells . A large epidemiologic study did not find associations with the use of saw palmetto and reduced risk of prostate cancer .In an exploratory study, a hexanic extract of S. repens demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in patients with BPH-related LUTS . In an open-label study, saw palmetto extract plus tamsulosin was found to be more effective than tamsulosin alone in reducing storage symptoms in BPH patients ; and a randomized trial reported benefits of saw palmetto and bifiprost for preventing chronic bacterial prostatitis due to enterobacteriaceae .Multi-phytotherapy approaches have also been investigated. One study suggests saw palmetto may benefit patients with chronic bacterial prostatitis when co-administered with nettle, curcumin, and quercitin . In addition, saw palmetto exerted anti-inflammatory effects when combined with selenium and lycopene . In randomized trials, patients with LUTS had greater improvement in International Prostate Symptom Scores (IPSS) and increased urine flow with this combination therapy in addition to tamsulosin than with either single therapy . The combination was also reported comparable to tadalafil for improving IPSS and urine flow .Due to the increased risk of normal tissue complications, patients should consult with a physician before using saw palmetto supplements during radiation therapy. Data on the effects of saw palmetto on symptom management during radiation therapy have yet to be published . | Saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) is a tree that grows up to 10 feet tall with thorn-shaped leaves arranged like a fan. Its ripe fruit is used to make medicine. Saw palmetto seems to lower the amount of pressure on the tubes that carry urine in males. Saw palmetto also might prevent testosterone from being converted to a more potent form called dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Reduced levels of DHT might help prevent some types of hair loss. People commonly use saw palmetto for symptoms of an enlarged prostate called benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH). But it doesn't seem to improve this condition. Saw palmetto is also used to prevent complications from prostate surgery and for treating other prostate conditions, male-pattern baldness, sexual dysfunction, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Saw palmetto is likely safe when used for up to 3 years. Side effects are usually mild and might include dizziness, headache, nausea, and diarrhea. When given rectally : Saw palmetto is possibly safe when used for up to 30 days. It's unknown if it is safe to use for longer periods of time. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Saw palmetto is likely unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy or breast-feeding. It acts like a hormone, and this could be dangerous. Don't use during pregnancy or breast-feeding. Surgery : Saw palmetto might slow blood clotting. It might cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using saw palmetto at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Studies with a liposterolic extract of saw palmetto berries showed that it reduced tissue uptake of both testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by more than 40%, suggesting antiandrogenic activity (7). Further, the extract inhibited binding of DHT to its receptor (8) and blocked conversion of testosterone to DHT by inhibiting 5-alpha-reductase activity (9). The berries also inhibit cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase pathways, thereby preventing the biosynthesis of inflammation-producing prostaglandins and leukotrienes (10). Other possible mechanisms attributed to benefits in BPH include the blocking of estrogen receptor activity in the prostate as well as bladder muscle antispasmodic and anti-inflammatory activities (42). Possible mechanisms by which saw palmetto could cause hot flashes and vasomotor symptoms especially in children include its antiestrogenic activity influencing physiological endocrine activity and increased availability of sex hormone-binding globulin (35) (43).Studies of a hexanic extract of S. repens suggests it decreases prostaglandin and leukotriene production to inhibit the arachidonic acid cascade and decreases B lymphocyte infiltrates and interleukin (IL)-1b and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a levels to adjust inflammatory status and gene expression (36). In animal models of prostate hyperplasia, it demonstrated a global anti-inflammatory effect on hyperplastic prostates with lobe-specific anti-androgenic effects (44). In human prostate and vascular cells in an inflammatory environment, it also decreases monocyte chemotactic protein-1 production and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression (37). In human prostate carcinoma cells, inhibitory effects on cell growth were attributed to downregulation of inflammatory-related genes and activation of nuclear factor-kappa B pathway (45).A chalcanonol glycoside from the seeds of saw palmetto as well as sterolic derivatives have demonstrated antiproliferative effects (46).",Fruit,"American dwarf palm tree | Cabbage palm | American Dwarf Palm Tree, Baies du Chou Palmiste, Baies du Palmier Scie, Cabbage Palm, Chou Palmiste, Ju-Zhong, Palma Enana Americana, Palmier de Floride, Palmier Nain, Palmier Nain Américain, Palmier Scie, Sabal, Sabal Fructus, Sabal serrulata, Saw Palmetto Berry, Serenoa repens, Serenoa serrulata.",Serenoa repens,Saw Palmetto,Saw Palmetto,Saw Palmetto

Corn silk is used for chest pain (angina), high blood pressure, preventing a group of eye disorders that can lead to vision loss (glaucoma), and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any uses.","When taken by mouth : Corn silk is LIKELY SAFE for most people in amounts commonly found in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if it is safe when used as a medicine. Corn silk can decrease potassium levels in the blood and can cause skin rashes, itching, and allergies. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Corn silk is POSSIBLY SAFE when used in the amounts normally found in food when pregnant or breast-feeding. But larger amounts are LIKELY UNSAFE when pregnant, because corn silk might stimulate the uterus and cause a miscarriage. There isn't enough reliable information to know if corn silk is safe to use in larger amounts when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts. Diabetes : There is some concern that large amounts of corn silk might lower blood sugar. This could interfere with blood sugar control in people who have diabetes. Low blood pressure : Large amounts of corn silk might lower blood pressure even further. Blood levels of potassium that are too low : Large amounts of corn silk might make these conditions worse. Corn allergy : Applying lotions that contain corn silk might cause a rash, red skin, and itchiness if you are allergic to corn silk, corn pollen, or cornstarch.

DSI000002,Selenium,C0521939,"Selenium, an essential dietary trace mineral, is an important component of cellular antioxidant defense systems that include enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase . It also plays an important role in thyroid function. Selenium can be obtained from the diet by consuming whole grains, meats, seafood, poultry, and nuts. It is sold in supplemental form to boost immune function and for disease prevention. Studies on the role of selenium in reducing cardiovascular disease risk are inconclusive , although a meta-analysis suggests benefit with antioxidant mixtures when they contain selenium . Data are also mixed on whether supplementation can reduce viral load in patients with HIV . Although it may improve glucose metabolism and reduce markers of inflammation and oxidative stress , supplementation is not useful in preventing diabetes and in some cases may increase the risk . Selenium alone or in combination with vitamin E also did not prevent dementia . In studies on the relationship between selenium and cancer prevention, data suggest it may help prevent gastrointestinal and lung cancers, although findings from bladder cancer research are conflicting . Other studies on whether selenium status impacts cancer risk are also mixed , and a review of RCTs did not find clear evidence of cancer preventive potential . In addition, the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) failed to find protective effects against prostate cancer or colorectal adenomas . In other studies, selenium along with soy and vitamin E did not prevent prostate cancer progression , and selenium taken with lycopene did not modulate prostate cancer risk . Moreover, selenium levels may influence the risk of aggressive prostate cancer , and supplementation may increase prostate cancer mortality . A chemoprevention trial of selenium in patients with non-small cell lung cancer did not show benefit, but did suggest a possible nonsignificant increase in secondary lung cancers . Long-term supplementation may increase the risk for certain types of skin cancer as well . With respect to dietary intake, no association between dietary selenium and thyroid cancer incidence was found . A few studies suggest selenium supplementation may reduce some cancer treatment side effects including hair loss, abdominal pain, loss of appetite , diarrhea , fatigue and nausea , head and neck lymphedema , and salivary gland damage . However, more studies are needed and supplementation in patients with low levels or during active treatment should be under the guidance of healthcare practitioners in cancer populations. | Selenium is an essential trace mineral found in soil, water, and some foods. It is an important factor in many body processes. Selenium increases antioxidant effects in the body. Crab, fish, poultry, and wheat are generally good food sources. The amount of selenium in soil varies, and foods grown in different soils have different selenium levels. The Eastern Coastal Plain and Pacific Northwest have the lowest selenium levels in the US. People commonly use selenium for selenium deficiency and to reduce the risk for high blood pressure during pregnancy. It is also used for prostate cancer, complications from statin drugs, abnormal cholesterol levels, cataracts, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using selenium for COVID-19.","When taken by mouth : Selenium is likely safe when taken in doses less than 400 mcg daily, short-term. But selenium is possibly unsafe when taken in high doses or for a long time. Taking doses above 400 mcg daily can increase the risk of developing selenium toxicity. Taking lower doses for a long time can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Selenium can cause stomach discomfort, headache, and rash. High doses can cause hair loss, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Extremely high doses can lead to organ failure and death. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding :  Selenium is possibly safe when used short-term in amounts that are not above 400 mcg daily. Selenium is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in doses above 400 mcg daily. This dose might cause toxicity. Children : Selenium is possibly safe when taken by mouth appropriately. Selenium seems to be safe when used short-term in doses below 45 mcg daily for infants up to age 6 months, 60 mcg daily for infants 7-12 months, 90 mcg daily for children 1-3 years, 150 mcg daily for children 4-8 years, 280 mcg daily for children 9-13 years, and 400 mcg daily for children age 14 years and older. Autoimmune diseases : Selenium might stimulate the immune system. People with autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and other should avoid taking selenium supplements. Hemodialysis : Blood levels of selenium can be low in people on hemodialysis. Selenium supplements might be needed for some people. Under-active thyroid (hypothyroidism) : Taking selenium can worsen hypothyroidism, especially in people with iodine deficiency. In this case, you should take iodine along with selenium. Check with your healthcare provider before taking selenium supplements. Fertility problems in males : Selenium might decrease the ability of sperm to move, which could reduce fertility. Skin cancer : In people who have had nonmelanoma skin cancer, long-term use of selenium supplements might slightly increase the risk of cancer returning. Avoid long-term use of selenium supplements if you have ever had skin cancer. Surgery : Selenium might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop taking selenium at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Selenium is an essential structural element of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione-peroxidase that converts aggressive oxidation products and intracellular free radicals into less reactive or neutral components (3). Other biological functions of selenium include regulation of thyroid hormone action and regulation of the reduction status of vitamin C (2).
In lab studies, selenium protected against adriamycin-induced cardiac dysfunction via restoring ATP-sensitive potassium channel expression (34). It induced a multitargeted cell death process characterized by unfolded protein response, ER-stress, and occurrence of large cytoplasmic vacuoles in addition to ROS formation (31). However, excessive selenium intake induces hepatic insulin resistance through an opposite regulation of ROS (32). The effects of dietary selenium on progression of malignant mesothelioma tumors depend on arising cancer cell redox metabolism and tumor ability to benefit from increased selenium intake (33).","Sodium selenate | Seafood, poultry, meat, whole grains, and nuts","Selenocysteine | Selenomethionine | Selenate | Selenite | Atomic number 34, Chélate de Sélénium, Chelated Selenium, Dioxyde de Sélénium, Ebselen, L-Selenomethionine, L-Sélénométhionine, Levure Sélénisée, Numéro Atomique 34, Quelato de Selenio, Se, Selenio, Selenio Quelado, Selenite, Sélénite de Sodium, Sélénium, Selenium Chelate, Sélénium Chélaté, Selenium Dioxide, Selenized Yeast, Selenomethionine, Sélénométhionine, Sodium Selenite.",Selenium,Selenium | Selenium nitrate | Selenium Picolinate,Selenium,Selenium

DSI000006,Zinc,C3541396,"Zinc is an essential element necessary for human physiologic functions including enzymatic reactions, bone formation, and regulation of synaptic signaling. It is thought to have antioxidant and immunostimulant activities, and is used as a dietary supplement to treat the common cold, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, warts, and male infertility. Zinc is also an ingredient in some over-the-counter products such as topical creams and denture adhesives. Zinc sulfate is the most studied supplement, but other forms such as gluconate are also marketed for their higher absorption. Zinc deficiency is relatively rare in the United States, and more common in developing countries, in patients with various health conditions, and in those who habitually consume vegetarian diets . Deficiency has been linked to various chronic ailments , increased mortality , and infertility , but supplementation in men planning infertility treatment did not improve semen quality or live birth rates . Studies on whether short-term use of zinc lozenges can help reduce common cold symptoms are mixed . Data from clinical trials suggest supplementation may reduce duration but not severity of cold symptoms if taken within 24 hours of onset . In certain pediatric populations, zinc supplementation may help reduce respiratory tract infections or diarrhea . However, study results among children with cystic fibrosis are mixed , and a Cochrane review cites a lack of corresponding reduction in required intravenous antibiotics . Zinc supplementation also had a negative treatment effect in severe pediatric bacterial pneumonia, causing significantly longer hospital stays and slower recovery . Other studies report that zinc supplementation may reduce markers of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in children . In the elderly, zinc supplementation increased serum concentrations and was associated with enhanced T-cell function . However, high-dose zinc with or without high-dose ascorbic acid did not reduce COVID symptoms among ambulatory adult patients . Zinc supplementation was also ineffective against rheumatoid arthritis, and serum concentrations can actually be higher in patients with RA than in healthy individuals . Among HIV-positive adults with heavy alcohol use, zinc supplementation did not reduce mortality or cardiovascular disease risks . Animal models and human studies have linked zinc deficiency to an increased risk of developing esophageal squamous cell carcinoma while both deficiency and excess intake (more than 100 mg/day) were linked to prostate cancer . However, zinc >15 mg/day for 10 years may reduce risk of advanced prostate cancer . At the same time, epidemiological studies illustrate a relationship between high zinc levels in breast tissue and breast cancer . Taken together, research suggests that optimal zinc intake plays a role in achieving protective effects. Zinc may help manage some symptoms associated with cancer treatments, but evidence is mixed. Small studies suggest it may help reduce infection or fatigue in some patients undergoing chemotherapy . Supplementation was reported to reduce mucositis in some patients receiving radiation or chemotherapy , but not in head and neck cancer patients . Data are also mixed on whether it can help in taste preservation or improve survival . A meta-analysis suggests that overall, zinc-based therapy may reduce incidence of radiation-induced dysgeusia, but have minimal effects against ongoing symptoms . | Zinc is an essential trace element commonly found in red meat, poultry, and fish. It is necessary in small amounts for human health, growth, and sense of taste. Zinc is found throughout the body. The body doesn't store excess zinc, so it must be obtained from the diet. It's needed for immune function, wound healing, blood clotting, thyroid function, and much more. It also plays a key role in maintaining vision and might have effects against viruses. People commonly use zinc for zinc deficiency, diarrhea, and Wilson disease. Zinc is also used for acne, diabetes, anorexia, burns, and many other purposes. There is some scientific evidence to support its use for some of these conditions. But for most, there is no good scientific evidence to support its use. There is also no good evidence to support using zinc for COVID-19.","When taken by mouth : Zinc is likely safe when used in amounts no greater than 40 mg daily. It is possibly safe when taken in larger doses, especially when used only for a short period of time. But taking doses higher than 40 mg daily might decrease how much copper the body absorbs. Taking very high doses of zinc is likely unsafe and might cause stomach pain, vomiting, and many other problems. Single doses of 10-30 grams of zinc can be fatal. When applied to the skin : Zinc is likely safe. Using zinc on broken skin may cause burning, stinging, itching, and tingling. When inhaled : Zinc is possibly unsafe when inhaled through the nose. It might cause permanent loss of smell. Avoid using nose sprays containing zinc. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Zinc is likely safe when used in the recommended amounts while pregnant. But it is likely unsafe when used in high doses. Those over 18 should not take more than 40 mg of zinc daily, and those 14-18 years old should not take more than 34 mg daily while pregnant. Breast-feeding : Zinc is likely safe when used in the recommended amounts while breast-feeding. But zinc is possibly unsafe when used in high doses. Those over 18 years old should not take more than 40 mg of zinc daily, and those 14-18 years old should not take more than 34 mg daily while breast-feeding. Children : Zinc is likely safe when taken by mouth appropriately in recommended amounts. Daily doses of zinc should not exceed 4 mg daily in infants 0-6 months old, 5 mg daily in infants 7-12 months old, 7 mg daily in children 1-3 years old, 12 mg daily in children 4-8 years old, 23 mg daily in children 9-13 years old, and 34 mg daily in those 14-18 years old. In infants, it is possibly unsafe to apply topical zinc to broken skin. The zinc can be absorbed through the breaks in the skin and cause serious adverse effects. Alcohol use disorder : Long-term, excessive alcohol use may reduce the body's ability to absorb zinc. Surgery for weight-loss (bariatric surgery) : Bariatric surgery reduces the absorption of zinc and might increase the risk for zinc deficiency. Zinc levels may need to be monitored. Kidney disease : Low intake of zinc in the diet might increase the risk of getting kidney disease. Also, people with kidney disease who are on hemodialysis are at risk for zinc deficiency and might require zinc supplements. Vegetarianism : Vegetarian diets are often linked with lower zinc absorption. But the body adapts over time. It becomes better at absorbing zinc and reducing zinc loss.","Zinc is a component of many proteins and performs a number of catalytic, structural, and regulatory functions. It is essential for the structural formation of biologically active molecules such as copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD), and enzymes including RNA polymerases, alcohol dehydrogenase, carbonic anhydrase, and alkaline phosphatase that depend on zinc as a cofactor (26) (45) (46). Zinc influences protein kinase C activity, immunocompetence, apoptosis, and metallothionein levels and has a number of antioxidant and antiinflammatory functions (9) (16) (45) (47) (48). However, whether zinc elicits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, or antiapoptotic effects is concentration-dependent and relies on an intricate balance. Under conditions of zinc overload or deficiency, zinc ions become pro-oxidant, proinflammatory, and proapoptotic (46).
The role of zinc in taste perception likely relates to the presence of alkaline phosphatase within the taste-bud membrane (49). Zinc accumulation in bone tissue activates alkaline phosphatase and stimulates collagen synthesis in osteoblasts, which are involved in bone mineralization and calcification (50). Zinc has the ability to complex with viral coat proteins, altering assembly of viral particles (51), and its deficiency increases humoral and cell-mediated immunity dysfunction and susceptibility to infection (47). Supplemental zinc can reduce the ability of the rhinovirus to attach to the human respiratory tract (6). In patients with a common cold, zinc decreases plasma soluble interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1fa) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), a cellular receptor for rhinovirus (4). In men with reduced sperm motility, zinc supplementation reduces oxidative stress, apoptosis, and sperm DNA fragmentation (27).
Zinc works with metallothioneins, Cu/Zn SOD, and p53 to combat oxidative stress and mediate DNA damage response and repair (52) (53). In vitro, intracellular zinc accumulation inhibits proliferation of human prostate cancer cells by causing G2/M arrest and upregulating CDKN1A gene expression, which expresses p21 (54) (55). Further, zinc deficiency depresses nuclear p21 and p53 levels (56). Animal models of esophageal cancer demonstrate that zinc-deficiency induces overexpression of proinflammatory mediators S100a8 and S100a9 as well as chemokines, chemokine receptors, cytokines, and Cox-2 (32) (33). Zinc replenishment reduces and also reverses these proinflammatory signatures (33).
Zinc dyshomeostasis has been implicated in breast cancer as a modulator of oxidative stress, DNA damage response/repair pathways, and cell proliferation/apoptosis (52). A diverse group of zinc transporters other than those associated with breast cancer play a role in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis in prostate, pancreatic and ovarian cancers, suggesting zinc dysregulation in cancer is cell-type specific (52) (53) (54) (57).","Zinc oxide | Meats, fish, poultry, legumes, and whole grains","Zinc gluconate | Zinc sulfate | Zinc acetate | Zinc picolinate | Acétate de Zinc, Acexamate de Zinc, Aspartate de Zinc, Atomic Number 30, Chelated Zinc, Chlorure de Zinc, Citrate de Zinc, Gluconate de Zinc, Méthionine de Zinc, Monométhionine de Zinc, Numéro Atomique 30, Orotate de Zinc, Oxyde de Zinc, Picolinate de Zinc, Pyrithione de Zinc, Sulfate de Zinc, Zinc Acetate, Zinc Acetate Hydrate, Zinc Acetylmethionate, Zinc Acexamate, Zinc Aspartate, Zinc carbobenzoxy-beta-alanyltaurinate , Zinc Chelate, Zinc Chloride, Zinc Citrate, Zinc Difumarate Hydrate, Zinc Gluconate, Zinc Glycinate, Zinc Methionine, Zinc Monomethionine, Zinc Murakab, Zinc Nicotinate, Zinc Orotate, Zinc Oxide, Zinc Picolinate, Zinc Pyrithione, Zinc Sulfate, Zinc Sulphate, Zincum Aceticum, Zincum Gluconicum, Zincum Metallicum, Zincum Valerianicum, Zn.",Zinc | Zinc Bisglycinate,Zinc osporotate | Zinc,Zinc,Zinc

It is found in the cartilage and fluid around the joints as well as in marine invertebrate exoskeletons. Glucosamine has anti-inflammatory effects, and is marketed as a dietary supplement and often paired with chondroitin sulfate for joint health.Glucosamine has been mostly studied for osteoarthritis (OA). Although glucosamine/chondroitin supplementation was comparable to celecoxib in a large multicenter trial of patients with severe knee OA pain , and reduced circulating inflammatory cytokine IL-6 , other studies have not found benefit with glucosamine, chondroitin, or the combination for knee or hip OA . Data on chondroitin alone also suggest no significant benefit . In addition, no efficacy was seen with glucosamine for back pain , degenerative lumbar OA , or improving glucose metabolism in type 2 diabetes . Any benefits with glucosamine may be limited to older patients who have arthritis that is more severe or for longer periods of time .Meta-analyses of glucosamine trials are also mixed . The American College of Rheumatology conditionally recommends that patients avoid glucosamine for OA . In contrast, the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis treatment guidelines recommend a prescription glucosamine formulation as being superior to other forms, but this product is not available in the US . It is further suggested that these differences in availability and formulas have contributed to the lack of significant effect across studies and pooled analyses . Additionally, interindividual differences in the absorption and elimination of glucosamine may cause variable clinical outcomes in OA according to a study of healthy adults .Clinical trials on whether glucosamine can improve temporomandibular joint symptoms are limited, providing low or no evidence of this effect although one study of oral glucosamine adjunctive to hyaluronic acid injection suggests long-term benefit . Preliminary studies of other combination treatments with glucosamine for various types of OA suggest improvements in pain and function , but more studies are needed to confirm these effects.Glucosamine has been assessed for its potential role against depression. Although preclinical studies suggested antidepressive effects, a clinical investigation failed to find any benefit .Exploratory findings suggest glucosamine may benefit gut health . Larger studies are needed to confirm these effects.Glucosamine/chondroitin supplementation has been correlated with reduction in cancer risk and mortality, although limitations such as bias could not be ruled out and confirmatory studies are needed .Glucosamine use has been associated with a higher risk for cardiovascular diseases in patients with osteoarthritis along with case reports of liver injury/toxicity . Patients on antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapies should be monitored for interactions or increased INR levels . Patients with poorly controlled diabetes or glucose intolerance should be monitored as glucosamine could worsen insulin resistance . | Glucosamine is a chemical found in the body. Glucosamine supplements are sold as glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, and N-acetyl glucosamine. Glucosamine is used by the body to make other chemicals that build tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and the fluid that surrounds joints. Joints are cushioned by the fluid and cartilage around them. Taking glucosamine might increase the cartilage and fluid around joints and/or help prevent their breakdown. People commonly use glucosamine sulfate and glucosamine hydrochloride for osteoarthritis. Glucosamine is also used for joint pain, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these other uses.","When taken by mouth : Glucosamine sulfate is likely safe in most adults when used for up to 3 years. Glucosamine hydrochloride is possibly safe for most adults when used for up to 2 years. N-acetyl glucosamine is also possibly safe when used for up to 6 months. Glucosamine can cause some mild side effects including bloating, nausea, diarrhea, and constipation. When applied to the skin : N-acetyl glucosamine is possibly safe when used for up to 10 weeks. When given as an enema (rectally) : N-acetyl glucosamine is possibly safe when used in doses of 3-4 grams daily. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if glucosamine sulfate, glucosamine hydrochloride, or N-acetyl glucosamine is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Asthma : Glucosamine might make asthma worse. Until more is known, people with asthma should be cautious about taking products that contain glucosamine. Diabetes : There used to be some concern that glucosamine might increase blood sugar levels. But most research shows that glucosamine doesn't increase blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Glaucoma : Glucosamine might increase the pressure inside the eye and could worsen glaucoma. If you have glaucoma, talk to your healthcare provider before taking glucosamine. High cholesterol : There used to be some concern that glucosamine might increase cholesterol levels. But most research shows that glucosamine doesn't seem to increase cholesterol levels. High blood pressure : There used to be some concern that glucosamine might increase blood pressure. But most research shows that glucosamine does not seem to increase blood pressure. Shellfish allergy : Glucosamine is produced from the shells of shrimp, lobster, and crabs. If you have a shellfish allergy, talk to your healthcare provider before using glucosamine.","Progressive degeneration of cartilage glycosaminoglycans is evident in osteoarthritis. Glucosamine is the first step in glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis. In vitro, it increased production of monomeric proteoglycans capable of assembling into high molecular weight aggregates (26). Glucosamine can protect cartilage from metabolic impairment by NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and by exerting anti-inflammatory effects (27). It may promote cartilage repair by inducing tissue TGFβ1 and CTGF expression that regulates chondrocyte proliferation (28). Long-term reductions in TMJ symptoms with adjunctive oral glucosamine may be due to TGF-beta stimulation and IL-1beta / IL-6 suppression (42). Reduced systemic inflammation and cytokine activity found in a small randomized crossover study may explain potential reductions in mortality or cancer risk (30).Although glucosamine is slow to act (31), its effects may persist after treatment cessation (26).The rise in intraocular pressure associated with older patients in one study may relate to exogenous glycosaminoglycans effects on accumulations of extracellular matrix and thickening of the basement membrane, thereby compromising function of the trabecular meshwork (29).","Glucosamine sulfate potassium chloride | Prawn exoskeleton | Glucosamine hydrochloride | Glucosamine sulfate potassium chloride from shrimp exoskeleton | Aspergillus niger, chitin | Shellfish Chitin","Glucosamine sulphate | Glucosamine hydrochloride | Chitosamine | (3R,4R,5S,6R)-3-Amino-6-(Hydroxymethyl)Oxane-2,4,5-Triol Hydrochloride, 2-Acetamido-2-deoxyglucose, 2-Amino-2-Deoxy-D-Glucosehydrochloride, 2-Amino-2-Deoxy-Beta-D-Glucopyranose Hydrochloride, 2-Amino-2-Deoxy-Glucose, 2-Amino-2-Deoxy-Beta-D-Glucopyranose, 2-Amino-2-Deoxy-D-Glucose Sulfate, 3-Amino-6-(Hydroxymethyl)Oxane-2,4,5-Triol Sulfate, Acetylglucosamine, Acétylglucosamine, Amino Monosaccharide, Chitosamine, Chitosamine Hydrochloride, Chlorhidrato de Glucosamina, Chlorhydrate de Glucosamine, Chlorure de Potassium-Sulfate de Glucosamine, D-Glucosamine, D-Glucosamine HCl, D-Glucosamine Hydrochloride, D-Glucosamine Sulfate, D-Glucosamine Sulphate, G6S, GlcNAc, Glucosamine HCl,  Glucosamine KCl, Glucosamine N-Acetyl, Glucosamine, Glucosamine Potassium Sulfate, Glucosamine Sulphate, Glucosamine Sulfate 2KCl, Glucosamine Sulfate-Potassium Chloride, Glucosamine Sulphate KCl, Glucosamine-6-Phosphate, GS, Mono-Sulfated Saccharide, N-Acetil Glucosamina, N-Acétyl Glucosamine, N-Acétyl-Glucosamine, N-Acétylglucosamine, N-Acetyl D-Glucosamine, N-Acétyl D-Glucosamine, NAG, N-A-G, pGlcNAc, Poly-N-Acetyl Glucosamine, Poly-NAG,  Poly-(1->3)-N-Acetyl-2-Amino-2-Deoxy-3-O-Beta-D-Glucopyranurosyl-4-(or 6-) Sul, p-GlcNAc, Saccharide Mono-Sulfaté, Saccharide Sulfaté, Sulfate de Glucosamine, Sulfate de Glucosamine 2KCl, SG, Sulfated Monosaccharide, Sulfated Saccharide, Sulfato de Glucosamina.",2-Amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose sulfate | 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose sulfate | 2-Amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose hydrochloride | D-Glucosamine sulphate | Glucosamine | Glucosamine HCL | Sulfate de glucosamine chlorure de pottasium  provenant d?exosquelettes de crabes  | Sulfate de glucosamine chlorure de sodium  provenant d?exosquelettes de crevettes  | Chlorhydrate de glucosamine  | N-Acetyl-L-Glucosamine,Glucosamine (mixed type) | Glucosamine (mixed) | Glucosamine (unspecified),Glucosamine,Glucosamine
DSI000008,Chondroitin sulfate,C0008466,"Chondroitin sulfate is a chemical found in human and animal cartilage. It is commonly used by mouth with glucosamine or other ingredients for osteoarthritis. Chondroitin sulfate is one of the building blocks of cartilage. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage in the joints breaks down. Taking chondroitin sulfate might slow this breakdown. It is usually manufactured from animal sources, such as shark and cow cartilage. It can also be made in a lab. Chondroitin sulfate is used for osteoarthritis and cataracts. It is often used together with other ingredients, including manganese ascorbate, hyaluronic acid, collagen peptides, or glucosamine. Chondroitin sulfate is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Chondroitin sulfate is likely safe when used for up to 6 years. It can cause some mild stomach pain and nausea. Other possible side effects include bloating, diarrhea, and constipation. When placed into the eye : Chondroitin sulfate is possibly safe when used together with other ingredients in an eye drop. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if chondroitin sulfate is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Asthma : There is some concern that chondroitin sulfate might make asthma worse. If you have asthma, use chondroitin sulfate cautiously. Prostate cancer : Early research suggests that chondroitin might cause the spread or recurrence of prostate cancer. This effect has not been shown with chondroitin sulfate supplements.

DSI000011,Vitamin A,C0087161,"Vitamin A is a group of nutrient compounds available from dietary sources including fruits, vegetables, eggs, dairy products, and fish. Vitamin A and its analogs such as beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, and cryptoxanthin are used as prescription drugs or dietary supplements to improve vision, skin conditions, immune function, growth and development in children, and to treat eczema and hepatitis C .In pediatric studies, supplementation appeared to benefit children , improve immune response to specific vaccines , reduce recurring urinary tract and parasitic infections , reduce clinical malaria episodes and improve plasma retinol levels in extremely preterm infants . However, other trials yielded conflicting data , and also do not support maternal or neonatal supplementation . In adults, preliminary findings suggest supplementation may inhibit progression of multiple sclerosis and improve fatigue and depression but evidence is lacking to support use of retinol-containing products to improve the appearance of aged skin .In oncology settings, some studies reported that late-stage breast cancer patients have lower serum vitamin A levels , and that diets richer in micronutrients including vitamin A can improve immune functioning and prognosis in head and neck cancer patients , and reduce the risk of oral and pharyngeal cancers . However, supplementation does not protect against non-small cell lung cancer or prolong survival for melanoma patients , and may actually elevate the risk of prostate cancer . Therefore it is best to obtain vitamin A from dietary sources, which can also protect against other chronic diseases. For instance, a meta-analysis found that having a diet rich in mixed carotenoids, which can then be converted to vitamin A in the body, benefits cardiometabolic health .Vitamin A is fat-soluble and supplement overuse may cause accumulation in the body. Doses greater than the recommended Daily Value of 5,000 IU or in conjunction with certain medications or pre-existing conditions may also result in adverse effects or toxicity . At the same time, vitamin A deficiency is the leading cause of preventable childhood blindness worldwide and often related to a lack of proper food access from poor socioeconomic status . Selective eating or restricted diet may also cause deficiencies and complications . In addition, a few cases of vitamin A deficiency-related retinopathy occurring years after abdominal surgeries have been possibly attributed to surgically-induced malabsorption: one related to multiple abdominal tumor resections , and another to bariatric surgery . | Vitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin. Its different forms are often called ""retinoids."" They include retinol, retinal, retinoic acid, and retinyl ester. Vitamin A is needed for the proper growth and functioning of many parts of the body, including the eyes, skin, and immune system. It can be found in many foods, including fruits, vegetables, and fish. Carotenoids are a group of chemicals found in plants. Some can be converted to vitamin A in the body. People most commonly use vitamin A for treating vitamin A deficiency. It is also used for aging skin, acne, HIV/AIDS, cataracts, child development, infections, and many other conditions.","When taken by mouth : Vitamin A is likely safe when taken in amounts less than 10,000 units (3,000 mcg) daily. Vitamin A is available in two forms: pre-formed vitamin A (retinol or retinyl ester) and provitamin A (carotenoids). The maximum daily dose relates to only pre-formed vitamin A. Pre-formed vitamin A is possibly unsafe when taken in doses greater than 10,000 units (3,000 mcg) daily. Higher doses might increase the risk of side effects. Long-term use of large amounts might cause serious side effects including mental changes. When applied to the skin : Vitamin A is possibly safe when used short-term. Retinol 0.5% serum has been used daily for up to 12 weeks without serious side effects. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Vitamin A is likely safe when taken in recommended amounts of less than 10,000 units (3,000 mcg) of pre-formed vitamin A daily. Larger amounts are possibly unsafe and can cause birth defects. Monitor vitamin A intake from all sources during the first three months of pregnancy. Forms of vitamin A are found in several foods including animal liver, some fortified breakfast cereals, and dietary supplements. Children : Vitamin A is likely safe when taken in the recommended amounts. The maximum amounts of vitamin A that are safe for children are based on age. Vitamin A is possibly unsafe for children when taken by mouth in high doses. Taking high doses can cause side effects, including irritability, sleepiness, diarrhea, and other problems. Excessive use of alcohol : Drinking alcohol might increase vitamin A's potentially harmful effects on the liver. Disorders in which the body does not absorb fat properly : People with conditions that affect fat absorption are not able to absorb vitamin A properly. These conditions include celiac disease, short gut syndrome, jaundice, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic disease, and cirrhosis of the liver. If you have one of these conditions, take water-soluble forms of vitamin A, called carotenoids, instead. Iron deficiency : Iron deficiency might affect the body's ability to use vitamin A. Liver disease : Too much vitamin A might make liver disease worse. Do not take vitamin A supplements if you have liver disease. Malnutrition : In people with severe protein malnutrition, taking vitamin A supplements might result in having too much vitamin A in the body. Zinc deficiency : Zinc deficiency might cause symptoms of vitamin A deficiency. Taking a combination of vitamin A and zinc supplements might be necessary to improve this condition.","Vitamin A is essential for many aspects of ocular metabolism, including conjunctival and corneal epithelial maintenance, retinal phototransduction, and retinal pigment epithelial cell viability (33). Nuclear receptor transcription factors are central to vitamin A activity, and most transcriptional actions require the retinoic acid receptor/retinoid x receptor (RXR/RAR) heterodimer (34). Transcriptional changes are linked to epigenetic changes in histones and DNA via recruitment of epigenetic modifying enzymes (35).All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) has been identified as the most important active metabolite in vitamin A for tissue homeostasis in adults and segmentation control in developing organisms (36). As such, retinoids that include ATRA along with natural and synthetic derivatives exhibit anticancer properties linked to their ability to induce cellular differentiation and growth suppression (35) (36).In animal models of melanoma, ATRA in combination with epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) from green tea enhanced 67-kDa laminin receptor expression and increased EGCG-induced cell growth inhibition (37). In estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer cells, ATRA halts telomerase activity and exerts antitumor effects via a rapid decrease of H3-K9 acetylation at the hTERT promoter (38). The protective effect of supplemental retinol against melanoma may be mediated by sunlight exposure (39).In multiple sclerosis patients, vitamin A supplementation as retinyl palmitate upregulated TGF-beta and FoxP3 gene expression (40) and decreased IFN-gamma and T-bet gene expression (41).Vitamin A competes with vitamin D for the same parathyroid hormone receptor (42).","Vitamin A palmitate | Preformed Vitamin A: Fortified and animal-based foods such as dairy products, liver, eggs, fishPro Vitamin A (beta-carotene): Carrots, sweet potato, cantaloupe, pumpkin, mango, papaya, dark leafy greens (9) (32)","Retinol | Retinal | Retinoic acid | Retinoid | Retinol palmitate | 3-Dehydroretinol, 3-Déhydrorétinol, Acétate de Rétinol, Antixerophthalmic Vitamin, Axerophtholum, Dehydroretinol,  Déhydrorétinol, Fat-Soluble Vitamin, Oleovitamin A, Palmitate de Rétinol, Retinoid, Retinoids, Rétinoïdes, Retinol, Rétinol, Retinol Acetate, Retinol Palmitate, Retinyl Acetate, Rétinyl Acétate, Retinyl Palmitate, Rétinyl Palmitate, Vitamin A Acetate, Vitamin A Palmitate, Vitamin A1, Vitamin A2,  Vitamina A, Vitamine A, Vitamine A1, Vitamine A2, Vitamine Liposoluble, Vitaminum A.",Vitamin A | Vitamin A aldehyde,Vitamin A (vitamin A cetate) | Vitamin A (retinol) | Vitamin A (retinyl not specified) | Vitamin A | Vitamin A (not specified) | Vitamin A (mixed) | Vitamin A (unspecified),Vitamin A,Vitamin A
DSI000012,Biotin,C0005575,"Biotin is an essential B vitamin that acts as an important coenzyme in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. It is often taken alone or in combination with other vitamins for skin, nail, and hair health. It is also thought to benefit patients with diabetes and neuromuscular disorders. Biotin is abundant in foods including meat, vegetables, and eggs. True deficiency is rare but can be caused by a genetic disorder or malabsorption syndrome. Long-term use of certain anticonvulsant drugs can also induce biotin deficiency . These can be treated with supplementation. Low serum levels of biotin have been associated with hair loss in some women , but evidence on biotin for hair growth or strengthening brittle nails is limited . Although preliminary data found benefit with high-dose biotin for multiple sclerosis , a larger well-designed trial did not, but did find the potential for adverse consequences stemming from inaccurate lab test results . A review also cited insufficient evidence to support this use . Exploratory studies suggest biotin may benefit patients with severe diabetic peripheral neuropathy , and improve glycemic control when taken with chromium . Randomized trials are needed to validate these observations. Some case reports suggest biotin may help reduce chemotherapy-related skin rash , but overall evidence is lacking to support its use for dermatological disorders . Cases of inaccurate diagnostic test results have been linked to biotin supplement consumption. The American Association of Clinical Chemistry has issued a guidance document to help identify and address biotin interference in lab testing , and newer-generation assays now prevent biotin interference for hsTnT and TSH testing . | Biotin (vitamin B7) is a vitamin found in foods like eggs, milk, and bananas. Biotin deficiency can cause thinning of the hair and a rash on the face. Biotin is an important part of enzymes in the body that break down substances like fats, carbohydrates, and others. There isn't a good test for detecting low biotin levels, so it's usually identified by its symptoms, which include thinning hair and red scaly rash around the eyes, nose, and mouth. Biotin is used for biotin deficiency. It is also commonly used for hair loss, brittle nails, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Biotin supplements might interfere with some lab tests. Talk with your doctor if you are taking biotin supplements and need to have any blood tests.","When taken by mouth : Biotin is likely safe for most people when taken in doses up to 300 mg daily for up to 6 months. But it is more commonly used in lower doses of 2.5 mg daily. When applied to the skin : Biotin is likely safe for most people when applied in cosmetic products that contain up to 0.6% biotin. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Biotin is likely safe when used in recommended amounts during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Children : Biotin is likely safe when taken by mouth. It's been used safely in doses of 5-25 mcg daily. An inherited condition in which the body cannot process biotin (biotinidase deficiency) : People with this condition might have low levels of biotin and may need a biotin supplement. Kidney dialysis : People receiving kidney dialysis might have low levels of biotin and may need a biotin supplement. Smoking : People who smoke might have low biotin levels and may need a biotin supplement. Laboratory tests : Taking biotin supplements might interfere with the results of many different blood lab tests. Biotin can cause falsely high or falsely low test results. This might lead to missed or incorrect diagnoses. Tell your doctor if you are taking biotin supplements, especially if you are having lab tests done. You may need to stop taking biotin before your blood test. Most multivitamins contain low doses of biotin, which are unlikely to interfere with blood tests. But talk to your doctor to be sure.","Biotin is an essential component in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. It is converted to the free active form by the enzyme biotinidase (1).

DSI000014,Folate,C0178638,"Folate is an essential member of the vitamin B complex family that is naturally present in grains, green leafy vegetables, and liver. Folic acid and the L-methylfolate derivative are synthetic supplemental forms that have higher bioavailability . Folate is important for cell growth and division, and is involved in methylation and DNA synthesis. Inadequate intake can cause deficiency leading to megaloblastic anemia. Folate is essential during pregnancy, with supplementation shown to reduce risks of neural tube birth defects and medulloblastoma in offspring . A study among South American populations suggests the protective effect against neural tube defects may be greater in female than male infants . In high doses (5 mg/day), it reduced homocysteine levels at time of delivery and may lessen pregnancy complications . Supplementation may also benefit women with polycystic ovary syndrome along with improving BMI , but supplements taken beyond the first trimester did not prevent pre-eclampsia in women at high risk for this disorder . In a large multicenter trial, folic acid and zinc supplementation by male partners of couples seeking infertility treatment did not improve semen quality or live birth rates . In postmenopausal women, folic acid may help reduce hot flushes, but confirmatory data are needed . In older adults, folic acid supplementation may improve cognitive function . In patients with Alzheimer’s disease, it improved response to cholinesterase inhibitors , cognition, and inflammatory markers . However, high folate / low vitamin B-12 status has been associated with impaired cognitive function in older adults . And although folic acid along with docosahexaenoic acid improved cognitive function and decreased plasma inflammatory cytokines better than each supplement alone in one study , other data suggest benefits with folic acid on cognitive function occur in those with a lower, rather than higher, omega-3 fatty acid status . But a combination of folic acid and vitamin-B12 did not affect the risk of fracture or cardiovascular disease in this population . Folic acid decreases homocysteine levels, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality , improves BMI in those with high homocysteine levels along with lowering blood pressure in smokers and in patients with CVD and overweight individuals . A combination of folic acid and vitamin B12 supplements also decreased homocysteine levels and improved anemia in patients with multiple sclerosis , but evidence is limited on whether supplementation has an effect on anemia in patients with sickle cell disease . Among hypertensive adults, folic acid therapy reduced risk of first stroke , but smoking status may affect efficacy . Other trials on stroke risk have yielded mixed results with meta-analyses confirming reductions in the risks of cardiovascular disease and stroke . In other studies, folate lowered blood arsenic concentrations of chronically exposed individuals by facilitating its urinary excretion . It was also associated with lower risk of progression of early-to-late age-related macular degeneration and when added to antipsychotics, may improve symptoms in schizophrenic patients , but did not have any significant effects on memory . Studies of folate vs cancer risk are mixed. Deficiency has been linked to development of esophageal squamous cell cancer and low levels of folate in the blood with certain forms of cancer , whereas higher levels of dietary folate may reduce the risk of breast and pancreatic cancers , but not prostate cancer . Folate supplementation may help cervical intraepithelial neoplasia regression , but studies on colorectal cancer risk produced mixed results and some even suggest a negative effect . A large population study suggested an association between dietary folate intake and increased risk for overall skin cancer, basal cell carcinoma, and non-melanoma skin cancer, particularly in women . Over-consumption of folic acid supplements may also increase risk of toxicity and some cancers . In young children, folic acid fortification was associated with reduced incidence of Wilms tumor and primitive neuroectodermal tumors . Studies of folic acid in combination with other B vitamins reported negative findings, with no overall effect on breast or invasive cancers , along with the potential for increased cancer incidence and mortality in patients with ischemic heart disease . Such interventions have also produced mixed results in studies for older adults with depression , and did not improve bone mineral density or reduce fracture risk or incidence . Further studies are needed for more definitive data. Due to its antagonistic effects, folic acid can reduce the side effects of methotrexate when used for rheumatoid arthritis . However, it may decrease the efficacy of methotrexate in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and psoriasis . Excess folate or folic acid may mask vitamin B12 deficiency . More research is needed to address the evidence and knowledge gaps related to the effects of higher intake of folate/folic acid on human health .",,"Folate acts as a co-enzyme during methylation. The bioactive form is tetrahydrofate, which can be converted from folic acid through the action of dihydrofolate reductase. Drugs that inhibit this enzyme can therefore reduce folic acid activity. The amino acid serine reacts with tetrahydrofolate, resulting in 5,10- methylenetetrahydrofolate, the derivative involved in nucleotide synthesis. In addition, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate transfers a methyl group to cobalamin (vitamin B12) and then to homocysteine, converting it to methionine, the precursor of methyl donor, S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM-e) that plays a major role in neurological function and several biochemical pathways (41). Genetic polymorphisms that lower the production of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can also reduce SAM-e and increase homocysteine levels. Supplementation with folic acid can therefore reduce homocysteine levels and DNA oxidative damage (57) (58). This may in turn lower risk of cardiovascular and psychiatric diseases by increasing SAM-e (59) (60). Folic acid supplementation also improves endothelial function (16) (31); and has a protective effect on retinal vascular endothelial cells from high glucose-induced injury via regulating proteins in the Hippo signaling pathway (76).
Although low folate status is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and some cancers (61), increased intake from fortified foods may actually raise cancer risk (49) (50) (62). There is also evidence that high levels of unmetabolized folic acid in plasma can reduce natural killer cell cytotoxicity (63).","Folate | Main sources include fortified breakfast cereals and breads, liver, Brussels sprouts, potatoes, spinach, chickpeas, and brewer’s yeast.",Folic acid | Vitamin B9,Folate,Folate,Folate,

It is also marketed as a dietary supplement, and as a non-flushing form of niacin. Nicotinamide has established medical uses to treat conditions stemming from niacin deficiency such as pellagra. Oral and topical formulations are used to treat a variety of inflammatory skin conditions including acne vulgaris and rosacea , hyperpigmentation and to prevent hair thinning . Preclinical models demonstrate photoimmunoprotective and chemopreventive effects against UV radiation . Nicotinamide enhances repair of UV radiation-induced DNA damage in human melanocytes and keratinocytes and similar effects have been demonstrated in human studies . It was also shown to improve inner retinal and visual function in patients treated for glaucoma. Other clinical trials show oral nicotinamide reduces UV-induced and photodynamic therapy (PDT)-induced immunosuppression. In patients with sun-damaged skin, oral nicotinamide helped prevent the occurrence of nonaggressive skin cancers . In a small trial among renal transplant patients however, similar effects were not significant . Other studies found a reduction in actinic keratoses, a predictor of melanoma risk , and a meta-analysis reported association with significant reductions in basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas, but increased risk of digestive adverse events . Additional studies are warranted . Nicotinamide appears to be largely well tolerated in clinical studies . Even though niacin is converted into nicotinamide in the body , these two supplements should not be viewed as interchangeable as they have different side effect profiles . | Niacinamide, also called nicotinamide, is a form of vitamin B3. It's found in many foods including meat, fish, milk, eggs, green vegetables, and cereals. Niacinamide is required for the function of fats and sugars in the body and to maintain healthy cells. Niacin is converted to niacinamide when it is taken in amounts greater than what is needed by the body. Unlike niacin, niacinamide doesn't help treat high cholesterol. People use niacinamide to prevent vitamin B3 deficiency and related conditions such as pellagra. It is also used for acne, diabetes, cancer, osteoarthritis, aging skin, skin discoloration, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. Do not confuse niacinamide with niacin, NADH, nicotinamide riboside, inositol nicotinate, or L-tryptophan.

It might cause side effects such as stomach upset, gas, dizziness, headache, and rash. When applied to the skin : Niacinamide is possibly safe. Niacinamide cream might cause mild burning, itching, or redness. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Niacinamide is likely safe when taken in recommended amounts. The maximum recommended amount while pregnant or breast-feeding is 30 mg daily for those under 18 years of age, and 35 mg daily for those over 18 years of age. Children : Niacinamide is likely safe when taken by mouth in the recommended amounts by age. Children should avoid taking niacinamide doses above the daily upper limits, which are 10 mg for children 1-3 years of age, 15 mg for children 4-8 years of age, 20 mg for children 9-13 years of age, and 30 mg for children 14-18 years of age. Diabetes : Niacinamide might increase blood sugar. People with diabetes who take niacinamide should check their blood sugar regularly. Gallbladder disease : Niacinamide might make gallbladder disease worse. Kidney dialysis : Taking niacinamide seems to increase the risk of low platelet levels in people with kidney failure who are on dialysis. Stomach or intestinal ulcers : Niacinamide might make ulcers worse. Don't use it if you have ulcers.","Nicotinamide is chemically part of the coenzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide NAD+ and NADH (1), used in oxidation-reduction reactions in the body. Among these activities is the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (11), which fuels cellular metabolic activities.
Photoimmunoprotective effects of oral or topical nicotinamide are linked to its support for DNA repair by preventing post-UV exposure declines in cellular energy or the repletion of energy to irradiated cells (4) (13). Its influence on several pathways contribute to this enhanced repair of UV-induced DNA damage (16). Skin cancer chemoprevention is attributed in part to reductions in inflammatory macrophages (22). In UV-irradiated keratinocytes, nicotinamide reduced expression of IL-6, IL-10, MCP-1 and TNF-alpha mRNA, cytokine mediators whose activity may be involved in inflammation, cellular-tissue injury, cell death, and skin cancer (17). In human melanocytes, nicotinamide increased the global nucleotide excision repair rate and number of irradiated melanocytes undergoing DNA repair (5).
Effects of topical nicotinamide on inflammatory skin conditions are attributed to its sebosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties (1).
Although niacin and nicotinamide are considered similar in their role as vitamins, their pharmacologic indications, effects, and side effects are different. Niacin has high affinity to a G-protein-coupled receptor HM74A in human cells resulting in the releasing of prostaglandins that cause vasodilation or flushing of the skin. It also lowers cholesterol (11) (18) .","Niacinamide | Niacinamide | Nicotinamide ascorbate | Niacinamide | Fish, poultry, eggs, nuts, legumes, beef, cereal grains, fortified foods; smaller amounts are also found in green vegetables.","Vitamin B3 | Niacinamide | Nicotinic acid amide | Nicotinic amide | Vitamin PP | 3-Pyridine Carboxamide, 3-Pyridinecarboxamide, Amide de l'Acide Nicotinique, B Complex Vitamin, Complexe de Vitamines B, Niacinamida, Niacinamide Ascorbate, Nicamid, Nicosedine, Nicotinamide, Nicotinic Acid Amide, Nicotylamidum, Pyridine-3-carboxamide, Vitamin B3, Vitamina B3, Vitamine B3.",Niacinamide | 3-Pyridinecarboxamide | Nicotinamide | Nicotinamidum,Nicotinamide Mononucleotide | Nicotinamide | Vitamin B3 (Niacinamide) | Vitamin B3 (nicotinamide),Nicotinamide,Niacinamide

It is essential for normal nerve function, DNA synthesis, hematopoiesis, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid synthesis in the mitochondria. It also plays an important role in homocysteine metabolism. Vitamin B12 is abundant in diets that include meat and dairy products, although deficiency can occur in those with malabsorption syndromes or those who take medications for gastric disorders , for conditions associated with insulin resistance , or in those who follow a strict vegetarian diet . B12 deficiency is also more common among the elderly . Lack of B12 can lead to a wide variety of hematologic, neurologic, and psychiatric disorders, may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease , and cause pseudo-thrombotic microangiopathy following gastrectomy . Vitamin B12 is often included in vitamin products used to reduce homocysteine, which is associated with cardiovascular diseases. High dietary intakes of B vitamins including B12 have been associated with a decreased risk for cataracts . However, combined supplementation with B12, B6, and folic acid may increase the risk of cataract extraction . Although low serum B12 levels have been associated with increased bone turnover and fracture risk , long-term B12 and folic acid supplementation did not improve bone mineral density , or reduce osteoporotic fracture incidence in elderly individuals with elevated plasma homocysteine levels . Repletion of vitamin B12 may improve response in patients resistant to antidepressants , and in older adults with major depression, long-term supplementation with a combination of B12, B6, and folic acid enhanced antidepressant treatment efficacy . However, such combined supplementation did not reduce depression risk among middle-age and older women despite significant reductions in homocysteine levels . Homocysteine-lowering therapy may have some cardiovascular benefits following coronary interventions , but does not appear to lower risk of further cardiovascular events including stroke . In addition, increased risk of in-stent restenosis with such treatment has been reported in patients after coronary stenting . Long-term B12 and folic acid supplementation also had no effect on arterial stiffness and atherosclerosis in elderly patients with hyperhomocysteinemia , and a meta-analysis suggests that evidence for cardiovascular preventive benefits with B-vitamins is lacking . In other studies, B12 did not improve cognitive function , but may positively affect gait and physical performance in the elderly , or reduce analgesic use in patients with postherpetic neuralgia . Studies of B vitamin supplementation for cancer prevention are also mixed , and long-term supplementation may actually increase risk for lung or colorectal cancers . Preliminary data suggest B12 supplementation may help reduce pain and improve quality of life in patients with aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal symptoms . However, individual B12 or iron supplement use during chemotherapy may be significantly associated with poorer outcomes . Additional studies are needed to elucidate these findings. | Vitamin B12 is an essential vitamin found in foods such as meat, fish, and dairy. It can also be made in a lab and is often taken with other B vitamins. Vitamin B12 is required for the function and development of many parts of the body, including the brain, nerves, and blood cells. Methylcobalamin is the active form of vitamin B12. Cyanocobalamin, which must be processed by the body into the active form, is the most common type used in supplements. People commonly use vitamin B12 for vitamin B12 deficiency, cyanide poisoning, and high levels of homocysteine in the blood. It is also used for canker sores, cataracts, Alzheimer disease, osteoporosis, fatigue, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses.","When taken by mouth : Vitamin B12 is likely safe for most people. Vitamin B12 is considered safe even in large doses. When applied to the skin : Vitamin B12 is likely safe for most people when used appropriately. When sprayed into the nose : Vitamin B12 is likely safe for most people. Vitamin B12 is considered safe even in large doses. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Vitamin B12 is likely safe when taken by mouth during pregnancy or breast-feeding in the amounts recommended. The recommended amount for pregnancy is 2.6 mcg per day. Those breast-feeding should take 2.8 mcg per day. The safety of larger amounts is unknown. Post-surgical stent placement : Avoid using a combination of vitamin B12, folate, and vitamin B6 after receiving a coronary stent. This combination may increase the risk of blood vessel narrowing. Allergy or sensitivity to cobalt or cobalamin : Do not use vitamin B12 if you have this condition.","Vitamin B12 is involved in the transfer of methyl groups, and in methylation reactions essential for the synthesis of phospholipids and neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. It is also required for synthesis of nucleic acid, notably DNA, the metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids in the mitochondria, and in delivering SAMe, the universal methyl donor (16) (30). In humans, two enzymatic reactions dependent on B12 are produced and activated in separate cellular compartments: methylcobalamin in the cytosol and adenosylcobalamin in the mitochondria (1). As a coenzyme in methyl transfer reactions, B12 converts homocysteine to methionine, and participates in L-methylmalonyl-coenzyme A (CoA) conversion to succinyl-CoA (8). In the first enzyme reaction, methylcobalamin is used to recycle the folate cofactor 5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate thereby allowing the folate cofactor to participate in a cycle involving the biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines. During this reaction, homocysteine is converted to methionine yielding the methyl groups required for methylation that is essential in biosynthesis (31).
When used with pemetrexed, B12/folic acid therapy further increases sub-G1 populations in human adenocarcinoma and large-cell carcinoma cell lines, independent of p53 status (28).","Vitamin B12 |

DSI000021,Vitamin B6,C0034272,"Vitamin B6 or pyridoxine, as part of the water-soluble vitamin B-complex family, is actually a mixture of 6 inter-convertible pyridine vitamers, or related compounds: pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, pyridoxal, and their 5′-phosphorylated forms . Although plants and microorganisms can synthesize B6 on their own, humans must acquire it from dietary sources. Because vitamin B6 is abundant in meats, fish, poultry, shellfish, leafy green vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole grains, deficiencies are rare. For example, patients taking the antituberculosis drug isoniazide need to take vitamin B6 to prevent drug-induced peripheral neuropathy. Patients may use supplemental B6 to treat symptoms related to heart disease, hypertension, peripheral neuropathies, carpal tunnel syndrome, and diabetes.Preclinical studies show that systemic administration of certain B vitamins including B6 has neuroprotective, antihypertensive , antinociceptive , and antitumor effects . In humans, higher B6 intake may lower serum homocysteine concentrations and decrease risk of progression to late age related macular degeneration but did not reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes . A systematic review determined that B6 may be useful in treating neuropsychiatric adverse effects associated with the antiepileptic drug Levetiracetam . High dietary intakes of folate and B6 have been associated with reduced risk of mortality from stroke, coronary heart disease, and heart failure . Intake of B6 has also inversely associated with metabolic syndrome . In older adults with mild cognitive impairment taking aspirin, B6 had favorable effects on global cognitive functioning .Studies suggest dietary intake of vitamin B6 may reduce risk for colorectal and pancreatic cancers , and lower intakes are associated with increased risk of some gastrointestinal cancers . Dietary B6 may also reduce risk of ovarian cancer and all cancers, although this may occur because of the many other micronutrients that are also ingested .Getting B6 through supplements is not associated with the same positive effects on disease risk. Conclusions from the Women’s Health Study indicate that supplementation with B6, B12, and folate did not decrease breast cancer risk , nor did it have an effect on overall risk of invasive cancer or breast cancer . Long-term supplementation was also associated with increased risk of lung cancer, especially in male smokers .Although vitamin B6 has been used empirically to prevent or treat chemotherapy-associated hand-foot syndrome (HFS), several randomized trials did not find benefit . But higher doses may have benefit . In one study, it did reduce the need for capecitabine dose modifications and incidence of severe HFS, but did not positively impact chemotherapy effects .High intakes of vitamin B6 can have toxic effects including sensory and motor neuropathies, and some case reports of neurotoxicity have not been reversible . In addition, a secondary analysis among postmenopausal women in the Nurses’ Health Study found that combined high intakes of B6 and B12 were associated with an unexpected increased risk of hip fracture . Large quantities of vitamin B6 should also be avoided in women who are pregnant or of childbearing potential . | Vitamin B6 is a type of B vitamin. Pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine are all forms of vitamin B6. It's found in certain foods and also made in a lab. Vitamin B6 is needed for the proper function of sugars, fats, and proteins in the body. It's also necessary for the development of the brain, nerves, skin, and many other parts of the body. It's found in cereals, legumes, and eggs, and often used with other B vitamins in vitamin B complex products. People commonly use vitamin B6 for preventing and treating vitamin B6 deficiency. It is also used for heart disease, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), depression, morning sickness, Alzheimer disease, menstrual cramps, diabetes, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses.","When taken by mouth : Vitamin B6 is likely safe when used appropriately. Taking vitamin B6 in doses of 100 mg daily or less is generally considered to be safe. Vitamin B6 is possibly safe when taken in doses of 101-200 mg daily. In some people, vitamin B6 might cause nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, headache, and other side effects. Vitamin B6 is possibly unsafe when taken in doses of 500 mg or more daily. High doses of vitamin B6, especially 1000 mg or more daily, might cause brain and nerve problems. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Vitamin B6 is likely safe when taken by mouth, appropriately. It's sometimes used to control morning sickness, but should only be done so under the supervision of a healthcare provider. Taking high doses is possibly unsafe. High doses might cause newborns to have seizures. Breast-feeding : Vitamin B6 is likely safe when taken in doses of 2 mg by mouth daily. Avoid using higher amounts. There isn't enough reliable information to know if taking higher doses of vitamin B6 is safe when breast-feeding. Post-surgical stent placement . Avoid using a combination of vitamin B6, folate, and vitamin B12 after receiving a coronary stent. This combination may increase the risk of blood vessel narrowing. Weight loss surgery . Taking a vitamin B6 supplement is not needed for people that have had weight loss surgery. Taking too much might increase the chance of side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and browning skin.","Vitamin B6 is a coenzyme in the folate metabolism pathway. Its phosphorylated metabolites are involved in amino acid metabolism, the transsulfuration pathway of homocysteine to cysteine, and glycogen phosphorylase activity which mobilizes glucose from glycogen (32). It is a cofactor along with cystathionine b synthase and cystathionase to produce cysteine and glutathione from their precursor homocysteine (33). Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is the major coenzyme form, the most abundant in animal tissue, and the cofactor for over 100 enzymes used in amino acid metabolism, including aminotransferases, decarboxylases, racemases, and dehydrases. It also facilitates mobilization of glucose units from glycogen via glycogen phosphorylase (32). PLP is also the active antiemetic form of B6, of which pyridoxine and pyridoxal have been identified as prodrugs (45).In animal models, an excess-pyridoxine diet actively influenced cell-mediated immunity via enhanced IFN-γ production and Th1-polarization (34). In several cancer cell lines, B6 contributed to increased p21 gene expression via p53 activation (4). Proposed mechanisms for an inverse relationship of B6 intake and serum PLP with cancer risk include: 1) its participation in one-carbon metabolism that is essential for DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation; 2) the high uracil and chromosome breaks caused by B6 deficiency which may interfere with these processes leading to aberrant gene expression, DNA instability, and eventual disease; and 3) possible cancer-suppression effects through reductions in cell proliferation, angiogenesis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and nitric oxide synthesis (16) (21).At the same time, because PLP is the metabolically active form of B6, it is thought to be responsible for instances of vitamin B6 toxicity (29). High circulating pyridoxine levels may have direct toxic effects on peripheral sensory ganglia neurons in the lower blood–nerve barrier, whereas the blood–brain barrier protects neurons in those regions from higher levels (35). The negative impact of B6 upon levels of other B vitamins appears to be dose-dependent and occur with chronic exposure (29).","Pyridoxine hydrochloride | Pyridoxine hydrochloride | Pyridoxine hydrochloride | Meats, fish, shellfish, poultry, leafy green vegetables, legumes, fruits, and whole grains (5) (30) (31)","Pyridoxine | Pyridoxal | Pyridoxamine | Pyridoxic acid | Adermine Chlorhydrate, Adermine Hydrochloride, B Complex Vitamin, B6, Chlorhydrate de pyridoxine, Complexe de Vitamines B, Phosphate de Pyridoxal, Phosphate de Pyridoxamine, Piridoxina, Pyridoxal, Pyridoxal Phosphate, Pyridoxal 5 Phosphate, Pyridoxal-5-Phosphate, Pyridoxal-5'-Phosphate, Pyridoxamine, Pyridoxamine Phosphate, Pyridoxamine-5'-Phosphate, Pyridoxine, Pyridoxine HCl, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Pyridoxine Phosphoserinate, Pyridoxine-5-Phosphate, Pyridoxine-5'-Phosphate, P5P, P-5-P, Vitamin B-6, Vitamina B6, Vitamine B6.","Vitamin B6 | Pyridoxinum hydrochloricum | Pyridoxine | 5-Hydroxy-6-methyl-3,4-pyridinedimethanol",Pyridoxine (Vitamin B6) | Vitamin B6 (pyridoxal) | Vitamin B6 (Mixed) | Vitamin B6 | Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine HCl) | Vitamin B6 (not specified) | Vitamin B6 (unspecified) | Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) | Vitamin B6 (various),Vitamin B6,Vitamin B6
DSI000022,Vitamin D,C3537249,"Vitamin D refers to several forms of fat-soluble vitamins found in fortified milk and cereals, egg yolks, and fish. The two forms utilized in humans are ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3). Sunlight can promote the synthesis of D3 in the skin. Vitamin D maintains serum calcium and phosphorus levels by regulating their absorption and excretion, and is important for bone formation. Other biologic functions include its role as an antiproliferative agent , and as a pro-differentiation hormone with anti-inflammatory and immunoregulatory properties . Low levels of vitamin D are associated with a greater risk of mortality , may affect cardiovascular health , and increase the risk for development of multiple sclerosis in women , but a large study found no association between lower levels and cognitive function . However, deficiency during pregnancy may affect neurocognitive development in newborns . Deficiency can also cause rickets or other bone disorders, and may be a risk factor for extraskeletal diseases . Lower D levels may occur due to time of year or living in northern climates ; in non-Caucasian race or obese individuals ; with chronic use of steroids or anticonvulsants; or with diseases such as autoimmune disorders , cystic fibrosis , kidney disease, and cancer .Although some studies suggest vitamin D improves bone mineral density and prevents fractures in the elderly and in postmenopausal women , it did not lower risk of fractures in midlife and older adults or improve lower extremity function and was associated with an increased fall risk in older adults . Safety concerns also arose with doses of 1000 IU/d or higher in older persons who had elevated fall risk and low serum D levels but conflicting findings do not support such concerns . Data are also conflicting for primary fracture prevention in other populations , and a meta-analysis did not find benefit for preventing fractures or falls, or for bone mineral density . In healthy adults, D3 also does not appear to decrease fall risk and high-dose supplementation did not benefit bone health , with 4000 or 10,000 IU compared with 400 IU resulting in greater bone mineral density loss in healthy vitamin D-sufficient women, but not men . Supplementation did not affect the rate of frailty change or incidence over time in healthy community-dwelling older adults , and US Preventive Services Task Force reports also found no associations between supplementation and reduced falls or fracture incidence in this subset . Another study failed to find associations between vitamin D status and chronic pain .Findings on whether vitamin D protects against cardiovascular (CV) risk factors have varied across populations and regimens. In a Women’s Health Initiative sub-study, calcium plus vitamin D and hormone therapy had a greater effect than either intervention alone or placebo , but vitamin D did not improve CV risk factors or physical function in large long-term trials of older adults or reduce all-cause mortality in older adults who are vitamin D-replete . Meta-analyses also found no effect on vascular function markers nor reduction in CV disease endpoints . Yet in another placebo-controlled trial, supplementation benefited diabetic patients with coronary artery disease who were vitamin D-deficient . In addition, a single large dose of vitamin D2 improved endothelial function in type-2 diabetic patients . In non-dialysis patients with chronic kidney disease, D3 was more effective than D2 in raising serum D levels . Dietary vitamin D intake was shown to be inversely associated with mortality from stroke , but supplementation was not associated with reduced all-cause mortality in critically ill patients , and did not reduce risk of atrial fibrillation .In other trials, vitamin D did not significantly reduce upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) in healthy adults , or infections/antibiotic use in the elderly . However, it may protect against influenza and reduce wheezing in some infants . Vitamin D was not helpful for mild psoriasis or seasonal affective disorder . Supplementation may reduce relapse risk in Crohn’s disease , and D3 plus calcium may have a small effect on postmenopausal weight gain . A single oral high-dose of D3 significantly improved fatigue in healthy persons who were vitamin D-deficient . Supplementation may also improve sexual function in women with sexual dysfunction and vitamin D deficiency , but a large study did not find any benefits of long-term supplementation for preventing depression in healthy adults . In a small study, higher serum levels of vitamin D were associated with increased beneficial gut bacteria and decreased pathogenic bacteria .In pediatric trials, vitamin D did not influence growth, body composition, or pubertal development , and did not prevent viral URTIs or tuberculosis . Vitamin D has also been examined for its anticancer potential. In animal models, dietary vitamin D3 exerted chemopreventive effects against breast cancer equivalent to those elicited by calcitriol without causing hypercalcemia . In humans, vitamin D from sunlight exposure and dietary intake may have protective effects against breast cancer , and insufficiency among breast cancer patients is high . In postmenopausal women not on estrogen therapy, vitamin D and calcium supplementation may reduce colorectal cancer incidence . In women with grade 1 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, long-term supplementation resulted in regression and improved metabolic status . However, in a large trial of healthy postmenopausal women with mean vitamin D levels above those of the US population, taking vitamin D3 plus calcium did not lower cancer risk after 4 years of supplementation , and vitamin D supplementation did not prevent aromatase-induced arthralgia or affect cognition when combined with calcium, protein and a multicomponent exercise training in men treated with ADT for prostate cancer . In addition, even though pooled analyses found associations between higher serum D levels and lower risks of breast and colon cancers , other analyses have not found preventive effects against cancer with high-dose supplementation , and contributing factors such as better diet and lifestyle habits may also be at play.In older patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, supplementation normalized vitamin D levels and enhanced efficacy of rituximab . Active vitamin D compounds may also decrease incidence of post-transplant malignancy among kidney transplant recipients .Other data reveal that vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in advanced pancreatic cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC) patients , and that CRC patients with higher blood 25(OH)D concentrations have better survival . A meta-analysis of vitamin D supplementation on CRC survival outcomes also suggests clinically meaningful benefit . In patients with metastatic CRC, addition of high-dose vitamin D3 to chemotherapy resulted in statistically insignificant progression-free survival but improved supportive hazard ratio . Increased vitamin D intake reduced CRC risk , but had no effect on colorectal adenomas . Data on benefits to reduce skin cancer risk and advanced cancers are mixed. Vitamin D did not have a protective effect against non-Hodgkin lymphoma , ovarian , kidney , endometrial , esophageal or gastric cancers, may significantly increase risk of pancreatic or aggressive prostate cancer , and did not improve relapse-free survival in patients with digestive tract cancers although conflicting findings in p53 immunoreactive subset suggest otherwise . Data from meta-analyses, however, are conflicting on whether vitamin D supplementation can reduce cancer incidence or mortality .Oral supplementation has been shown to be the safest way to increase vitamin D levels , although debate continues on how this may translate to optimizing vitamin D status . The Institute of Medicine recommends a Daily Dietary Allowance of vitamin D at 600 IU/day with the Upper Level Intake at 4,000 IU/day for bone health , although safety concerns have been noted with higher doses in some populations . Also, combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation has been associated with increased kidney stone incidence . Therefore, patients should consult with their physicians if a deficiency is suspected to assess the amount of vitamin D needed for health maintenance and to avoid side effects. | Vitamin D is an essential vitamin that helps regulate calcium and phosphorus in the body. It also plays a role in maintaining proper bone structure. There are different forms of vitamin D, including ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) and cholecalciferol (vitamin D3). Vitamin D is found in fish, eggs, and fortified milk. It's also made in the skin when exposed to sunlight. During periods of sunlight, vitamin D is stored in fat and then released when sunlight is not available. Vitamin D supplements are commonly used to treat and prevent vitamin D deficiency. People who don't get enough sun and people who are 65 years or older are at risk for deficiency. People also use vitamin D for weak and brittle bones, heart disease, asthma, hay fever, and many other conditions, but there's no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. There is also no strong evidence to support using vitamin D supplements for COVID-19. But it is important to maintain healthy levels of vitamin D. This can be done by taking 400-1000 IU of vitamin D daily or spending 15-30 minutes in the sun each day.","When taken by mouth : Vitamin D is likely safe when taken in recommended amounts. Most people don't experience side effects with vitamin D, unless too much is taken. Some side effects of taking too much vitamin D include weakness, dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, and others. Taking vitamin D for long periods of time in doses higher than 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily is possibly unsafe and may cause very high levels of calcium in the blood. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Vitamin D is likely safe during pregnancy and breast-feeding when used in daily amounts below 4000 IU (100 mcg). Do not use higher doses unless instructed by your healthcare provider. Vitamin D is possibly unsafe when used in higher amounts during pregnancy or while breast-feeding. Using higher doses might cause harm to the infant. Children : Vitamin D is likely safe in children when taken by mouth in recommended amounts. But it is possibly unsafe to take vitamin D in higher doses, long-term. Infants from 0-6 months should not take more than 1000 IU (25 mcg) daily. Infants aged 6-12 months should not take more than 1500 IU (37.5 mcg) daily. Children aged 1-3 years should not take more than 2500 IU (62.5 mcg) daily. Children aged 4-8 years should not take more than 3000 IU (75 mcg) daily. Children aged 9 years and older should not take more than 4000 IU (100 mcg) daily. Hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) : Taking vitamin D could make this condition worse, especially in people with kidney disease. A type of fungal infection called histoplasmosis : Vitamin D might increase calcium levels in people with histoplasmosis. This could lead to kidney stones and other problems. Use vitamin D cautiously. High levels of calcium in the blood : Taking vitamin D could make this condition worse. Over-active parathyroid gland (hyperparathyroidism) : Vitamin D might increase calcium levels in people with hyperparathyroidism. Use vitamin D cautiously. Lymphoma : Vitamin D might increase calcium levels in people with lymphoma. This could lead to kidney stones and other problems. Use vitamin D cautiously. Kidney disease : Vitamin D might increase calcium levels and increase the risk of ""hardening of the arteries"" in people with serious kidney disease. Calcium levels should be monitored carefully in people with kidney disease. A disease that causes swelling (inflammation) in body organs, usually the lungs or lymph nodes (sarcoidosis) : Vitamin D might increase calcium levels in people with sarcoidosis. This could lead to kidney stones and other problems. Use vitamin D cautiously. Tuberculosis : Vitamin D might increase calcium levels in people with tuberculosis. This could lead to kidney stones and other problems. Use vitamin D cautiously.","The most biologically active metabolite of vitamin D is calcitriol, which regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis (52). In humans, the primary function of vitamin D is to maintain normal levels of serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations by enhancing small intestine dietary absorption efficiency of these minerals. 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] enhances the efficiency of calcium and phosphorus absorption along the entire small intestine, but primarily in the duodenum and jejunum (5). When dietary calcium intake is insufficient, 25(OH)D and parathyroid hormone (PTH) mobilize monocytic stem cells in the bone marrow to become mature osteoclasts. These osteoclasts mobilize calcium from the bones, thereby maintaining blood calcium levels (50). Vitamin D is thought to have physiological effects in other parts of the body as well because vitamin D receptors (VDRs) are found in the cells of other organs that include intestines, kidney, stomach, brain, prostate, breast, and white blood cells (2) (53).The anticancer effect of vitamin D is thought to be due to induction of cell differentiation (1) (54) and antiproliferation (55). In lymphoma cells, interventional 25(OH)D3 to normalize levels (>30 ng/mL) resulted in significantly stronger antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, suggesting benefit in D-deficient individuals receiving rituximab (27). In xenograft models of breast cancer, dietary D3 elevated circulating D levels and increased CYP27B1 expression in both tumor and intestines, suggesting it stimulates local calcitriol synthesis in the tumor microenvironment and promotes the ensuing paracrine/autocrine actions that contribute to its anticancer activity (20). The upregulation of CYP27B1 expression by tumors was unique to D3 versus calcitriol in the same tissue (20). In other animal models, a positive feedback signaling loop between the serine-protein kinase ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and the VDR was identified as critical for cancer chemoprevention by vitamin D (56).Calcitriol, the hormonally active form of vitamin D3, targets the vitamin D degrading enzyme CYP24A1, which is most abundant in the kidney, but also expressed in several other tissues (57). CYP24A1 overexpression in colon, ovary, breast, lung, and esophageal malignancies, likely leads to degradation of the locally available D3, impairing its antitumorigenic action in the tumor tissue (57).","Cholecalciferol | Fatty fish, fish liver oils, egg yolks, fortified milk and cereals (5)","Vitamin D | Sunshine vitamin | D2; D3 | Alfacalcidol: 1-alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol, 1-alpha-hydroxycholécalciférol, 1 alpha (OH)D3.

DSI000041,Vitamin C,C2349136,"Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin that exists as either ascorbic acid or ascorbate. It is found in many fresh fruits and vegetables and is essential for a variety of physiologic functions. It is not synthesized in the human body, and deficiency can cause scurvy.Vitamin C is promoted as an antioxidant supplement to support immune health. Its effect on the common cold is generally minimal , and high-dose vitamin C alone or with high-dose zinc did not decrease SARS-CoV-2 symptoms . But supplementation in pregnant smokers improved respiratory health in the offspring .In large randomized trials, supplemental vitamin C did not reduce coronary heart disease risk . Further, it may increase risk of mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease .The role of vitamin C in cancer prevention is mixed .Although increased chemotherapy-associated adverse effects have been observed with inadequate vitamin C intake , there are also theories against the use of vitamin C supplements during treatment. Preclinical studies suggest cancer cells preferentially uptake vitamin C and render some chemotherapy drugs less effective . Also, a major concern with antioxidant use is potential interference with cancer treatments that rely on ROS production for their cytotoxic activities .Oral supplement studiesA few small trials suggest vitamin C along with other supplements may reduce some cancer therapy-induced side effects , but older trials in advanced cancer patients using 10 g per day of oral vitamin C did not yield significant benefit . This lack of effect may be explained by limited plasma concentrations reached via oral route in a pharmacokinetic study .Other small studies suggest supplementation does not reduce therapeutic effects of paclitaxel and carboplatin and may enhance effects of DNA methyl transferase inhibitors , but more studies are needed.Although adverse effects from vitamin C supplements are generally rare, there are reports of GI upset, kidney stone formation , and hemolytic anemia in patients with G6PDH deficiency . Patients with a history of oxalate kidney stones, renal insufficiency, hematochromatosis, or those undergoing chemotherapy should consult their physicians before taking vitamin C supplements.Intravenous high-dose studiesIntravenous high-dose vitamin C has been used as an alternative cancer treatment based on the hypothesis that formation of new collagen resists malignant infiltration . Higher pharmacologic concentrations had selective cytotoxic effects in cancer cell lines . Early reports of parenteral plus oral ascorbic acid showed promising results . High-dose IV ascorbic acid up to 1.5 g/kg/day or used with chemotherapy appears to be well-tolerated. Other preliminary data suggest various regimens may improve quality of life in terminal cancer patients and reduce chemotherapy-associated toxicity .However, high-dose IV vitamin C as an anticancer treatment should be considered an investigational drug used only in clinical trial settings, as it did not improve survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer , sepsis studies have not found benefit , and adverse events , and interference with glucometer readings have been reported. | Vitamin C is an essential vitamin that must be consumed in the diet. Good sources include fresh fruits and vegetables, especially citrus fruits. Vitamin C is needed for the body to develop and function properly. It plays an important role in immune function. Most experts recommend getting vitamin C from the diet rather than taking supplements. Fresh oranges and fresh-squeezed orange juice are good sources. Historically, vitamin C was used for preventing and treating scurvy. Today, people most commonly use vitamin C for preventing and treating the common cold. It's also used for autism, breast cancer, heart disease and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using vitamin C for COVID-19.","When taken by mouth : Vitamin C is likely safe for most people. In some people, vitamin C might cause side effects such as stomach cramps, nausea, heartburn, and headache. The chance of getting these side effects increases with higher doses. Taking more than 2000 mg daily is possibly unsafe and may cause kidney stones and severe diarrhea. In people who have had a kidney stone, taking amounts greater than 1000 mg daily increases the risk of getting more kidney stones. When applied to the skin : Vitamin C is likely safe for most people. It might cause irritation and tingling. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Vitamin C is likely safe to take by mouth during pregnancy in amounts no greater than 2000 mg daily for those 19 years and older and 1800 mg daily for those 14-18 years old. Taking too much vitamin C during pregnancy can cause problems for the newborn baby. Vitamin C is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in excessive amounts. Infants and children : Vitamin C is likely safe when taken by mouth appropriately. Vitamin C is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in amounts higher than 400 mg daily for children 1-3 years, 650 mg daily for children 4-8 years, 1200 mg daily for children 9-13 years, and 1800 mg daily for adolescents 14-18 years. Alcohol use disorder : People who regularly use alcohol, especially those who have other illnesses, often have vitamin C deficiency. These people might need to be treated for a longer time than normal to restore vitamin C levels to normal. Cancer : Cancerous cells collect high concentrations of vitamin C. Until more is known, only use high doses of vitamin C under the direction of your oncologist. Chronic kidney disease : Long-term kidney disease might increase the risk of vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C supplements might also increase the amount of oxalate in the urine in some people. Too much oxalate in the urine can increase the risk of kidney failure in people with kidney disease. A metabolic deficiency called ""glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase"" (G6PD) deficiency : Large amounts of vitamin C can cause red blood cells to break in people with this condition. Avoid excessive amounts of vitamin C. Kidney stones : Large amounts of vitamin C can increase the chance of getting kidney stones. Do not take vitamin C in amounts greater than those found in basic multivitamins. Smoking and chewing tobacco : Smoking and chewing tobacco lowers vitamin C levels. People who smoke or chew tobacco should consume more vitamin C in the diet.","Vitamin C is essential for the formation and polymerization of collagen, so its deficiency results in scurvy and poor wound healing (1). It also inhibits hyaluronidase leading to the hypothesis that it can prevent metastasis by strengthening collagen (45).Ascorbic acid acts as an antioxidant to protect against oxidative damage from free radicals (46). It inactivates nitric oxide, improves endothelium-dependent vasodilation (47), and acts via different mechanisms depending on its plasma concentration.Plasma concentrations <0.1 mM are achieved through oral intake of dietary or supplemental forms. At pharmacologic plasma concentrations of 0.3–20 mM via IV injection, ascorbic acid is oxidized to an ascorbate radical which acts as a prodrug for hydrogen peroxide formation within interstitial fluids (32) (33). This induces DNA damage and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, and triggers ataxia telangiectasia mutated/adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase and inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin in cancer cells (67).Other preclinical data suggest ascorbate can regulate hematopoietic stem cell function and leukemogenesis (77). In leukemic cells, vitamin C compensated for Tet2 mutations to restore normal function (78). In non-small-cell lung cancer and glioblastoma cells, pharmacological ascorbate selectively sensitized these cells (79). Ascorbate decreases colon cancer cell proliferation by downregulating specificity proteins (48). It also depletes ATP and induces autophagy and cell death in prostate cancer cells (49). Preferential oxidative cytotoxic effects on cancer cells may be due to the presence of intracellular iron (50), copper (51), increased p53 activity (52), and overexpression of sodium-dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (53). High-dose vitamin C also appeared to suppress metastasis of breast cancer cells by inhibiting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (82).Dehydroascorbic acid, the oxidized form of vitamin C, may have cytoprotective effects by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential (38).","Vitamin C | Citrus fruits, fresh vegetables, berries, melons","Ascorbate | Sodium ascorbate | Ascorbic Acid | Acide Ascorbique, Acide Cévitamique, Acide Iso-Ascorbique, Acide L-Ascorbique, Acido Ascorbico, Antiscorbutic Vitamin, Ascorbate, Ascorbate de Calcium, Ascorbate de Sodium, Ascorbic Acid, Ascorbic acid, Ascorbyl Palmitate, Ascorbyl Phosphate, Calcium Ascorbate, Cetyl Ascorbate, Cevitamic Acid, Chromium Ascorbate, Copper Ascorbate, Ferrous Ascorbate, Iron Ascorbate, Iso-Ascorbic Acid, L-Ascorbic Acid, Magnesium Ascorbate, Niacin Ascorbate, Niacinamide Ascorbate, Nicotinamide Ascorbate, Palmitate d'Ascorbyl, Phosphate Ascorbate, Potassium Ascorbate, Selenium Ascorbate, Sodium Ascorbate, Strontium Ascorbate, Vitamina C, Vitamine Antiscorbutique, Vitamine C, Zinc Ascorbate.",Vitamin C,Vitamin C (not specified) | Vitamin C (unspecified) | Vitamin C (mixed) | Vitamin C (ascorbic palmitate) | Vitamin C,Vitamin C,Vitamin C

DSI000045,Allium sativum,C0017102,"Derived from the bulb or clove of the plant, garlic is used as a spice and to treat hyperlipidemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, cancer, and infections. Processing can have a substantial effect on the chemical content of garlic because the volatile oil components are heat-sensitive and certain enzymes are acid-labile. The best measure of total activity of garlic is its ability to produce allicin, which in turn, results in the formation of other active constituents . Studies are mixed on whether garlic preparations can lower cholesterol or blood pressure , but meta-analyses suggest reductions in cardiovascular risk factors . Studies on protective effects against various cancers are also mixed. In a large trial, long-term garlic supplementation was associated with reduced risk of gastric cancer mortality but not incidence , although conflicting data did not find evidence for either . Whether garlic protects against Helicobacter pylori infection is also unclear . Meta-analyses are also mixed on whether garlic intake reduces colorectal cancer risk . Inverse associations have been identified between garlic consumption and risk of endometrial , prostate , and other cancers . Garlic supplementation may also be associated with reduced risk of hematologic malignancies . Because garlic is known to decrease platelet aggregation and potentially elevate INR values, it should not be used with anticoagulants or in patients with platelet dysfunction . | Bear's garlic is an herb.

People use bear's garlic for indigestion, intestinal gas, high blood pressure, skin rash, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. | Garlic (Allium sativum) is an herb related to onion, leeks, and chives. It is commonly used for conditions related to the heart and blood system. Garlic produces a chemical called allicin. This is what seems to make garlic work for certain conditions. Allicin also makes garlic smell. Some products are made ""odorless"" by aging the garlic, but this process can also change the effects of garlic. People commonly use garlic for high blood pressure, high levels of cholesterol or other fats in the blood, and hardening of the arteries. It is also used for the common cold, osteoarthritis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using garlic for COVID-19.","When taken by mouth : There isn't enough reliable information to know if bear's garlic is safe or what the side effects might be.

Bleeding disorder : Garlic, especially fresh garlic, might increase the risk of bleeding. Surgery : Garlic might prolong bleeding and interfere with blood pressure. Garlic might also lower blood sugar levels. Stop taking garlic at least two weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Intact cells of garlic contain alliin, an odorless sulfur-containing amino acid derivative. When the cells are crushed, alliin comes into contact with the enzyme alliinase located in neighboring cells and is converted to allicin. Allicin has antibacterial and antimicrobial activity, but is highly odoriferous and unstable. It also has antiplatelet and antihyperlipidemic activities. Most authorities agree that the best measure of total activity of garlic is the ability to produce allicin, which, in turn, results in the formation of other active constituents (1).
In patients with hyperlipidemia, garlic might lower cholesterol levels by acting as an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (21). Garlic may also reduce oxidative stress and LDL oxidation and have antithrombotic effects (22). It might reduce blood pressure by causing smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation (23).
Garlic may stimulate both humoral and cellular immunity, causing T-cell proliferation, restoring suppressed antibody responses (24), and stimulating macrophage cytotoxicity on tumor cells. It may increase selenium absorption with possible protection against tumorigenesis (25). In addition, garlic may protect against certain cancers by halting cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis of cancer cells as well as by decreasing angiogenesis and influencing carcinogen metabolism (26) (27).",Allium sativum - Bulb,"Nectar of the gods | Camphor of the poor | Da-suan | La-suan | Stinking rose | Ail des Bois, Ail à Feuilles Larges, Ail des Ours, Ail Pétiolé, Ajo de Oso, Ajo Silvestre, Allium ursinum, Baerlauch, Bear Garlic, Broad-leaved Garlic, Hog's Garlic, Ramsons, Wild Garlic, Wood Garlic. | Aged Black Garlic Extract, Aged Garlic Extract, Ail, Ail Blanc, Ail Cultive, Ail Rocambole, Ajo, Alho, Allii Sativi Bulbus, Allium, Allium sativum, Angio D'India, Black Garlic, Camphor Of The Poor, Clove Garlic, Common Garlic, Da Suan, Echte Rokkenbolle, Echter Knoblauch, Garlic Clove, Garlic Oil, Knoblauch, Lahsun, Lasun, Lasuna, Maneul, Nectar Of The Gods, Ninniku, Ophio Garlic, Poor Man's Treacle, Rason, Rocambole, Rockenbolle, Rust Treacle, Schlangenknoblauch, Serpent Garlic, Spanish Garlic, Stinking Rose, Suan, Thoum, Vitlok, White Garlic.",Allium sativum,Bear Garlic | Garlic pear | Garlic,Garlic,Bear's Garlic | Garlic

But DHA was shown to improve learning and memory function in age-related cognitive decline although a large, long-term study of omega-3 with or without multidomain lifestyle interventions of physical activity, cognitive training, and nutritional advice failed to find significant effects on cognitive decline in elderly adults with memory complaints .Studies are mixed on the effects of supplementation on incidence or progression of age-related macular degeneration .Omega-3 lowers cholesterol and may reduce recurrence in patients with a history of stroke . In individuals with cardiovascular risk factors, supplementation improved cardiometabolic profiles , but did not prevent incident atrial fibrillation nor lower the risk of cardiovascular disease events although a meta analysis reported that protective effects of EPA and DHA increase with dosage . Omega-3 may also help patients with ulcerative colitis , but was ineffective in the treatment of Crohn’s disease . In adults with rheumatoid arthritis, supplementation led to reductions in NSAID use and in NSAID-associated gastroduodenal damage . It may also lower the magnitude of the body’s inflammatory response , and can reduce sensitivity to sunburn and to ultraviolet radiation . Reviews indicate possible benefits for patients with cystic fibrosis , but not in those with asthma . Fish oil may help reduce the symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus . Another large trial also reported benefit, with or without vitamin D, in reducing the risk of autoimmune disease .In type 1 diabetic patients, long-term supplementation had positive effects on neuropathy, measured by increases in corneal nerve fiber length . But there was no significant benefit in patients with dry eye disease . A systematic review determined benefits of omega-3 on insulin sensitivity and adipocyte function . However, high-dose supplementation did not improve features associated with metabolic syndrome such as adipose tissue lipolysis or inflammation in insulin-resistant adults . In another trial, DHA was found more effective compared to eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) in modulating indicators of inflammation and blood lipids . In women with gestational diabetes, omega-3 and vitamin E improved some markers of inflammation and oxidative stress as well as incidence of newborn hyperbilirubinemia . In hemodialysis patients, omega-3 significantly reduced serum creatinine , but did not reduce arteriovenous fistula failure .Data on omega-3 for cancer prevention are inconclusive. It may reduce colon cancer risk ; improve immune response in patients undergoing colorectal cancer resection ; and reduce the incidence and severity of oxaliplatin-related neurotoxicity but did not affect cancer outcomes . Also, perioperative use of intravenous omega-3 resulted in infectious complications in patients undergoing elective colon resection for non-metastasized cancer . Conflicting data suggest beneficial association between higher omega-3 intake and improved survival among stage III colon cancer patients with wild-type KRAS and deficient MMR ; supplementation also reduced occurrence of renal cell carcinoma in women . Furthermore, fish oil may lower the risk of breast cancer ; improve overall survival and xerostomia, but not toxicity associated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. Data from the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) showed high blood levels of omega-3 to be associated with increased risk of prostate cancer . In patients with sporadic colorectal neoplasia, EPA did not affect reductions in the proportion of patients with at least one colorectal adenoma when compared to aspirin or placebo . Also, in the prevention trial VITAL, supplementation did not lower incidence of invasive cancer or major cardiovascular events compared to placebo although updated analyses show significant reduction in cancer mortality .Preliminary findings suggest that fish oil increases efficacy of chemotherapy, improves survival , and helps maintain weight and muscle mass in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); and improves quality of life scores in gastrointestinal cancer patients . But conflicting data suggest otherwise although a positive correlation was reported between adherence to supplementation and the ability to reduce weight loss during radiotherapy . Additional studies found an EPA-enriched oral supplement improved tolerability of chemotherapy in advanced colorectal cancer patients ; and when combined with chemotherapy, fish oil supplements may delay tumor progression in those with colorectal cancer . Omega-3 may also have a protective effect on the olfactory system in patients following endoscopic resection of sellar and parasellar masses .",,"Omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids containing two or more double bonds in their acyl chain and a double bond on carbon number (3) (26). Changes in omega-3 fatty acid blood levels have been associated with cardiovascular disease and depression (27). The cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids likely are due its ability to be incorporated into and thereby enhance the stability of atherosclerotic plaques (26). Increasing the intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids has been shown to increase lipid peroxidation. Supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, therefore, may increase oxidative stress on the body. Studies have shown that mucosal alpha-tocopherol levels decrease upon omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, which researchers believe may result from the body’s attempt to counteract the added oxidative burden (11). Besides reducing serum antioxidant levels, little is known about how this added oxidative stress affects the body.Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has been shown to decrease IL-6 (18) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (28) levels while leaving most other mononuclear cell functions unaffected (29). Omega-3 fatty acids may also reduce inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis by reducing rectal dialysate leukotriene B4 (10). Because of their anti-inflammatory effects, omega-3 fatty acids were thought to benefit patients with asthma (22) and cystic fibrosis (21), but data are inconclusive.Increasing PUFA intake in pregnant women increases PUFA concentration but not cytokine concentration in human milk (30). Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation provides protection against ultra-violet radiation-induced erythema and p53 expression, a biomarker of DNA damage (20).","Cod liver oil fish-liver |

DSI000057,Turmeric,C0041356,"Prevalent in South Asia, turmeric is now cultivated in tropical areas around the world. Its rhizome is used as a spice in regional cuisines, and as a coloring agent in food and cosmetics. It is also used in traditional medicine systems for improving circulation and digestion. Turmeric extracts are marketed as dietary supplements to improve memory, for arthritis, and for cancer prevention. The active constituents are turmerone oil and water-soluble curcuminoids, among which curcumin has been the focus of research the past few years. Preclinical studies showed that it has weak phytoestrogenic activity, although at a concentration not achievable by oral ingestion , and exhibits neuroprotective , choleretic , anti-inflammatory , immunomodulatory , anti-proliferative , as well as chemopreventive properties . Curcumin, its analogs, and liposomal formulations also demonstrated chemosensitizing and radiosensitizing effects . Clinical findings suggest benefits of turmeric for major depressive disorder , and epidemiological data indicate improved cognitive performance in elderly Asians who consumed turmeric . But there were no benefits of curcumin supplements in patients with Alzheimer’s disease . Turmeric may also help alleviate symptoms associated with gastrointestinal issues , irritable bowel syndrome and quiescent ulcerative colitis , as well as reduce arterial stiffness in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and benefit children and adolescents with asthma . It was also found safe and as effective as paracetamol or an NSAID for treating osteoarthritis of the knee, but did not affect knee effusion-synovitis or cartilage composition . Topical use of turmeric reduced the size of lesions in patients with vitiligo . Curcumin was also reported beneficial for osteoarthritis of knee and sarcopenia in older subjects . In postmenopausal women, curcumin combined with aerobic exercise training improved vascular endothelial function . But findings of its effects on serum cholesterol levels are mixed . A systematic review found that both turmeric and curcumin may benefit patients with non alcoholic fatty liver disease . When combined with antipsychotics, curcumin may also help control symptoms of chronic schizophrenia and was associated with significant reductions in serum CRP and IL-6 levels in hemodialysis patients . In cancer settings, preliminary findings suggest benefits of turmeric supplements in improving quality of life and hematological parameters in breast cancer patients and in decreasing rates of hand-foot syndrome following capecitabine treatment . In studies using curcumin, a phase II trial of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer reported clinically relevant biological activity in two patients despite limited absorption ; a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli and curcumin led to a reduction in the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) increase among men with prostate cancer following a PSA relapse post-radical treatment ; when given to colorectal cancer patients during the pre-surgery waiting period, curcumin improved cachexia and anorexia-cachexia syndrome in patients with advanced head and neck cancer but did not produce similar effects in patients with solid tumors ; and when combined with hydroxytyrosol and omega-3 fatty acids, curcumin may help reduce inflammation and pain in early breast cancer patients with aromatase-induced musculoskeletal symptoms . But in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, there was no reduction in lower intestinal tract adenomas with long-term use . Additionally, a curcumin mouthwash delayed the onset of radiation-induced oral mucositis and curcumin lozenges affected improvements in patients with oral submucous fibrosis . Topical application of either curcumin or turmeric helped control oral mucositis and radiotherapy-induced dermatitis . Furthermore, curcumin may serve as a useful adjunct to cancer treatments: When combined with docetaxel and gemcitabine , it was found to be safe in early phase studies, but high doses were needed to achieve systemic effect . In patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, curcumin was reported as a safe and tolerable adjunct to FOLFOX chemotherapy . However, curcumin is known to interfere with cytochrome P450 enzymes and may interact with chemotherapy drugs like cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin . Overall, the development of turmeric for clinical use needs further investigation due to its inherent poor absorption, rapid metabolism, complex mechanistic profile, and largely preclinical data. | Javanese turmeric (Curcuma xanthorrhiza) is a plant native to Indonesia and Malaysia. The root and rhizome are traditionally used for stomach disorders. Javanese turmeric contains chemicals that might increase bile production in the body. People use Javanese turmeric for indigestion, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), gallbladder problems, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse Javanese turmeric with Turmeric (Curcuma longa), Goldenseal, or Zedoary. These are different plants with different effects. | Tree turmeric (Berberis aristate) is a shrub found in India and Nepal. It contains high amounts of a chemical called berberine. The chemicals in tree turmeric might reduce blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Tree turmeric is widely used in Ayurveda and traditional Chinese medicine. People use tree turmeric for diabetes, high cholesterol, burns, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Do not confuse Tree turmeric with Turmeric (Curcuma longa). These are not the same plant. | Turmeric is a common spice that comes from the root of Curcuma longa. It contains a chemical called curcumin, which might reduce swelling. Turmeric has a warm, bitter taste and is frequently used to flavor or color curry powders, mustards, butters, and cheeses. Because curcumin and other chemicals in turmeric might decrease swelling, it is often used to treat conditions that involve pain and inflammation. People commonly use turmeric for osteoarthritis. It is also used for hay fever, depression, high cholesterol, a type of liver disease, and itching, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using turmeric for COVID-19. Don't confuse turmeric with Javanese turmeric root or tree turmeric. Also, don't confuse it with zedoary or goldenseal, which are unrelated plants that are sometimes called turmeric.","When taken by mouth : Javanese turmeric is possibly safe when used at a dose of 60 mg daily for up to 18 weeks. Javanese turmeric is possibly unsafe when used in larger amounts or for longer periods of time. It might cause stomach irritation and nausea. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if Javanese turmeric is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Liver or gallbladder disease : Don't use Javanese turmeric if you have liver or gallbladder problems. Javanese turmeric can increase the production of bile, and that could make your condition worse. If you have gallstones, talk to your healthcare provider before using Javanese turmeric. | When taken by mouth : A specific tree turmeric product that also contains milk thistle (Berberol, PharmExtracta) is likely safe. The most common side effects are nausea and other stomach problems. There isn't enough reliable information to know if other forms of tree turmeric are safe. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : It's likely unsafe to use tree turmeric while pregnant. It contains a chemical called berberine, which can cross the placenta and might cause harm to the fetus. Kernicterus, a type of brain damage, has developed in newborn infants exposed to berberine. Breast-feeding : It's likely unsafe to use tree turmeric while breast-feeding. The berberine in tree turmeric can be transferred to the infant through breast milk, and it might cause harm. Children : Tree turmeric is likely unsafe to give to newborn infants by mouth. It contains a chemical called berberine which can cause kernicterus, a rare type of brain damage. There isn't enough reliable information to know if berberine is safe for older children. High bilirubin levels in the blood in infants : Tree turmeric may keep the liver from removing bilirubin fast enough. This can cause brain problems, especially in infants with high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Avoid using. | When taken by mouth : Turmeric is likely safe when used short-term. Turmeric products that provide up to 8 grams of curcumin daily seem to be safe when used for up to 2 months, Also, taking up to 3 grams of turmeric daily seems to be safe when used for up to 3 months. Turmeric usually doesn't cause serious side effects. Some people can experience mild side effects such as stomach upset, nausea, dizziness, or diarrhea. These side effects are more common at higher doses. When applied to the skin : Turmeric is likely safe. It is possibly safe when turmeric is applied inside the mouth as a mouthwash. When applied into the rectum : Turmeric is possibly safe when used as an enema. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Turmeric is commonly used in small amounts as a spice in foods. But it's likely unsafe to use larger amounts of turmeric as a medicine during pregnancy. It might cause a menstrual period or stimulate the uterus, putting the pregnancy at risk. Do not take medicinal amounts of turmeric if you are pregnant. Breast-feeding : Turmeric is commonly used in small amounts as a spice in foods. But there isn't enough reliable information to know if turmeric is safe to use in medicinal amounts during breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Gallbladder problems : Turmeric can make gallbladder problems worse. Do not use turmeric if you have gallstones or a bile duct obstruction. Bleeding problems : Taking turmeric might slow blood clotting. This might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding in people with bleeding disorders. Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Turmeric contains a chemical called curcumin, which might act like the hormone estrogen. In theory, this might have effects on hormone-sensitive conditions. Until more is known, use cautiously if you have a condition that might be made worse by exposure to hormones. Infertility : Turmeric might lower testosterone levels and decrease sperm movement. This might reduce fertility. Turmeric should be used cautiously by people trying to have a baby. Liver disease : There is some concern that turmeric can damage the liver, especially in people who have swelling (inflammation) of the liver (hepatitis) or reduced or blocked flow of bile from the liver (cholestasis). Don't use turmeric if you have these liver problems. Surgery : Turmeric might slow blood clotting. It might cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using turmeric at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","The hepatoprotective effects of curcumin, the most researched active constituent in turmeric, may occur via MMP-13 induction and TGF-alpha inhibition (30), as well as anti-apoptotic/anti-necrotic mechanisms (31). However, it has also been shown to inhibit cell-cycle progression during normal liver regeneration (3).
A  meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials revealed that curcumin is effective in decreasing the concentration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a key mediator in many inflammatory diseases (68).  In vitro and animal studies of lung models point to antiproliferative and modulatory mechanisms involving inhibition of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 Stat3 pathway (32), matrix metalloproteinase, and vascular endothelial growth factor (33); caspase- and mitochondria-dependent apoptosis (34) (35); and cyclin-dependent kinase downregulation (35). Curcumin also appears to have synergistic effects with isoflavones, suppressing the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) production in prostate cells through anti-androgen effects (36).
Studies done on breast cancer show that curcumin may inhibit chemotherapy-induced apoptosis via inhibition of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (28). Data also suggest that curcumin induces apoptosis in human colon cancer cells independent of p21 expression (39). Curcumin’s antitumor actions appear to be due to its interactions with arachidonate metabolism and its in vivo antiangiogenic properties (14). Another possible chemopreventive mechanism may be via binding and activating the vitamin D receptor (VDR), thereby protecting the small intestine and colon where VDRs are expressed and vitamin D is known to serve an anticancer function (38). Curcumin also inhibited growth of uterine leiomyosarcoma cells by targeting the AKT-mTOR (RAC-alpha serine-threonine-protein kinase; mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway (37). Curcumin may inhibit bladder cancer progression by downregulating the expression of beta-catenin, high levels of which are associated with several cancers (69).
Another study found that CRM1, an important nuclear exportin, is a cellular target of curcumin; and that the inhibition of nuclear traffic by curcumin may be responsible for its many biological effects (63).","Turmeric is a major ingredient in curry powder, a spice mix commonly used in South Asian cuisine.","Indian saffron | Curcumin | Jiang huang | Curcuma, Curcuma de Java, Curcuma Javanais, Cúrcuma Javanesa, Curcuma xanthorrhiza, Curcumae Xanthorrhizae Rhizoma, Java Turmeric, Safran des Indes, Témoé-lawacq, Témoé-lawaq, Temu Lawak, Temu Lawas, Tewon Lawa. | Berberis aristata, Berberis chitria, Berberis coriaria, Bérbero Indio, Chitra, Citra, Darhahed, Darhald, Daruhaldi, Daruharidra, Darurajani, Darvi, Épine-Vinette Aristée, Hint Amberparisi, Indian Barberry, Indian Berberry, Indian Lycium, Indian Ophthalmic Barberry, Nepal Barberry, Nepalese Barberry, Ophthalmic Barberry. | Curcuma, Curcuma Aromatica, Curcuma Domestica, Curcumae Longa, Curcumae Longae Rhizoma, Curcumin, Curcumine, Curcuminoid, Curcuminoïde, Curcuminoïdes, Curcuminoids, Halada, Haldi, Haridra, Indian Saffron, Nisha, Pian Jiang Huang, Racine de Curcuma, Radix Curcumae, Rajani, Rhizoma Cucurmae Longae, Safran Bourbon, Safran de Batallita, Safran des Indes, Turmeric Root, Yu Jin.",Turmeric,Javanese Turmeric | Tree Turmeric | Turmeric,Turmeric,Javanese Turmeric | Tree Turmeric | Turmeric

It is found in coffee, tea, cola, cocoa, guarana, yerba mate, and over 60 other products. Caffeine works by stimulating the central nervous system, heart, muscles, and the centers that control blood pressure. Caffeine can raise blood pressure, but might not have this effect in people who use it all the time. Caffeine can also act like a ""water pill"" that increases urine flow. People most commonly use caffeine for mental alertness, headache, migraine, athletic performance, memory, and obesity. It is also used for asthma, gallbladder disease, ADHD, low blood pressure, depression, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses. Caffeine products sold in very concentrated or pure forms are a health concern. People can easily take doses that are much too high by mistake.

It is marketed as a dietary supplement for diabetes, weight loss, and to improve muscle mass. Trivalent chromium from yeast extract is sometimes referred to as glucose tolerance factor in over-the-counter products. Although most people consume adequate amounts through diet, chromium deficiency has been implicated in the development of diabetes . In vitro studies suggest that chromium produces beneficial modulatory effects under hyperglycemic conditions . Animal models also suggest antidiabetic , antidepressant , and anxiolytic properties. In human studies, chromium supplementation with biotin may help improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes , but results from other studies on chromium alone are mixed . Other data suggest chromium picolinate may increase satiety . However, many clinical studies failed to demonstrate improvements in glucose metabolism, weight loss, or muscle mass . More recently one meta-analysis suggested that overall, chromium monosupplementation improved glycemic control and lipid profiles , while another determined that chromium picolinate did not affect A1C or fasting plasma glucose . It has been posited that mixed and modest effect sizes may reflect a greater glucoregulatory effect in complex patients with comorbid diabetes, depression, and binge eating . A large population study suggests that those who consumed chromium-containing supplements have a reduced risk of diabetes, but more study is needed . In women with polycystic ovary syndrome, chromium supplementation did not affect endocrine profiles, and nitric oxide or glutathione levels, but did reduce acne, hirsutism, C-reactive protein, total antioxidant capacity, and malondialdehyde levels . However, meta-analyses suggest that for PCOS patients, chromium supplementation may not have significant benefits or the magnitude of effect is small, with clinical relevance uncertain . Chromium is poorly absorbed following oral administration, but salt forms such as chromium picolinate, niacin-bound chromium, and chromium chloride, appear to have better bioavailability. Other novel chromium compounds also have improved bioavailability . Adverse effects are rare but can include renal failure , rhabdomyolysis , liver damage , and dermatitis . | Chromium is an essential trace mineral. There are two forms: trivalent chromium, which is safe for humans, and hexavalent chromium, which is a toxin. Trivalent chromium is found in foods and supplements. It might help keep blood sugar levels normal by improving the way the body uses insulin. People use chromium for chromium deficiency. It is also used for diabetes, high cholesterol, athletic performance, bipolar disorder, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. This topic only covers trivalent chromium, not hexavalent chromium.","When taken by mouth : Chromium is likely safe when used short-term. Up to 1000 mcg of chromium daily has been used safely for up to 6 months. When taken for longer periods of time, chromium is possibly safe. Chromium has been used safely in doses of 200-1000 mcg daily for up to 2 years. Some people experience side effects such as stomach upset, headaches, insomnia, and mood changes. High doses have been linked to more serious side effects including liver or kidney damage. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Chromium is likely safe when taken by mouth in amounts that do not exceed adequate intake (AI) levels. The AI for those 14-18 years old is 28 mcg daily. For those 19-50 years old, it is 30 mcg daily. Chromium is possibly safe to use in amounts higher than the AI levels while pregnant. But don't take chromium supplements during pregnancy unless advised to do so by a healthcare provider. Breast-feeding : Chromium is likely safe  when taken by mouth in amounts that do not exceed AI levels. The AI for those 14-18 years old is 44 mcg daily. For those 19-50 years old, it is 45 mcg daily. There isn't enough reliable information to know if taking higher amounts of chromium is safe when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick with amounts below the AI. Children : Chromium is likely safe when taken by mouth in amounts that don't exceed AI levels. For those 0-6 months old, it is 0.2 mcg; for those 7-12 months old, it is 5.5 mcg; for those 1-3 years old, it is 11 mcg; for those 4-8 years old, it is 15 mcg. For males 9-13 years old, it is 25 mcg; for males 14-18 years old, it is 35 mcg. For females 9-13 years old, it is 21 mcg; for females 14-18 years old, it is 24 mcg. Taking chromium in amounts above the AI level is possibly safe for most children. Behavioral or psychiatric conditions such as depression, anxiety, or schizophrenia : Chromium might affect brain chemistry and might make behavioral or psychiatric conditions worse. Chromate/leather contact allergy : Chromium supplements can cause allergic reactions in people with chromate or leather contact allergy. Symptoms include redness, swelling, and scaling of the skin. Kidney disease : Chromium supplements might cause kidney damage. Don't take chromium supplements if you have kidney disease. Liver disease : Chromium supplements might cause liver damage. Don't take chromium supplements if you have liver disease.","Chromium is an essential trace element involved with glucose and lipid metabolism, circulating insulin levels, and the peripheral activity of insulin (1). In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that chromium potentiates the activity of insulin (23) (42). This is thought to occur via enhanced intracellular tyrosine kinase activity that results from an interaction between chromium, low molecular weight chromium-binding substance, and activated cell surface insulin receptors (2).
In animal models of diabetes, chromium recovered beta cell functioning and alleviated macroangiopathy (27). It also augmented the insulin signaling pathway, dulled negative-regulators of insulin signaling, enhanced AMPK activity to increase cellular glucose uptake, and attenuated oxidative stress (42). Chromium may also modulate PPAR-gamma, insulin receptor substrate, and NF-κB proteins (28). Antidepressant effects occur via modified brain 5-HT function and increased serotonergic and noradrenergic functioning (30) (31). Additional mechanisms for antidepressant and anxiolytic effects include lower plasma corticosterone levels via reversal of HPA axis overactivity (32). In humans, suggested antidepressant mechanisms include 5HT2A downregulation and increased insulin sensitivity (38).","Chromium (III) citrate | Chromium (III) oxide | Chromium (III) sulfate | Chromium (III) potassium sulfate | Liver, American cheese, broccoli, brewer’s yeast, wheat germ, meat, eggs, chicken, fish, fruits, whole grains, brown sugar, alfalfa, and animal fats (1) (25)","Chromium III | Chromium picolinate | Niacin-bound chromium | Chromium chloride | Acétate de Chrome, Atomic Number 24, Chélate de Chrome, Chelated Chromium, Chlorure Chromique, Chlorure de Chrome, Chrome, Chrome III, Chrome 3+, Chrome Chélaté, Chrome FTG, Chrome Facteur de Tolérance au Glucose, Chrome Trivalent, Chromic Chloride, Chromium Acetate, Chromium Ascorbate, Chromium Chelate, Chromium Chloride, Chromium Nicotinate, Chromium Picolinate, Chromium Polynicotinate, Chromium Proteinate, Chromium Trichloride, Chromium Tripicolinate, Chromium III, Chromium III Picolinate, Chromium 3+, Cr III, Cr3+, Cr, Cromo, Cromo Quelado, Glucose Tolerance Factor-Cr, GTF, GTF Chromium, GTF-Cr, Kali Bichromicum, Nicotinate de Chrome, Numéro Atomique 24, Picolinate de Chrome, Picolinate de Chrome III, Polynicotinate de Chrome, Potassium Bichromate, Protéinate de Chrome, Quelato de Cromo, Trichlorure de Chrome, Tripicolinate de Chrome, Trivalent Chromium, Cr.",Chromium | Chromium oxydatum | Chromium sulphuricum | Chromium kali sulphuricum,Chromium | Chromium carnosinate | Chromium Yeast | Chromium acetate | Chromium glutathionate | Chromium nitrate | Chromium Polynicotinate | Yeast (Chromium),Chromium,Chromium

DSI000063,Paullinia cupana,C1123034,"A bushy plant prevalent in the Amazon Basin, guarana is used in traditional medicine to treat fevers, headaches, and dysentery. The plant’s physiological actions are attributed to the caffeine found in its seeds . Guarana is promoted as an appetite suppressant, stimulant, as an aphrodisiac, and to alleviate fatigue. In vitro studies indicate that guarana has chemopreventive , neuroprotective, and anxiolytic properties. Epidemiologic data suggest protective effects against metabolic disorders in elderly populations , and guarana supplementation led to improvements in cognitive performance and mental fatigue in healthy adults . Small studies in cancer patients suggest guarana may help reduce chemotherapy-related fatigue, stabilize weight, and increase appetite . However, it did not reduce fatigue post-radiation or in patients with head and neck cancers, and some symptoms worsened compared with a placebo . A meta-analysis also concluded that guarana was not superior to placebo for cancer-related fatigue and that evidence was of low quality . Further research is needed. | Guarana (Paullinia cupana) is a plant native to the Amazon. It is a common ingredient of energy drinks and can be unsafe in large amounts. Guarana contains caffeine. Caffeine works by stimulating the central nervous system, heart, and muscles. Guarana also contains theophylline and theobromine, which are chemicals similar to caffeine. People take guarana by mouth for obesity, athletic performance, mental performance, to increase energy, and for many other reasons, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Guarana can also be unsafe when taken long-term in large amounts.","When taken by mouth : Guarana is likely safe for most adults when taken in amounts commonly found in foods. Guarana is possibly safe when taken as medicine, short-term. When taken in high doses for a long time, guarana is possibly unsafe. Guarana contains caffeine. Doses containing more than 400 mg of caffeine daily have been linked to side effects. Side effects depend on the dose. At typical doses, the caffeine in guarana can cause insomnia, nervousness, stomach irritation, vomiting, and many other side effects. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Guarana is possibly safe during pregnancy when taken in amounts commonly found in foods. If you are pregnant, guarana should be taken with caution due to the caffeine content. Small amounts are probably not harmful. However, taking guarana in high doses by mouth is possibly unsafe. Consuming more than 300 mg of caffeine daily has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage and other negative effects. Breast-feeding : Caffeine passes into breast milk and can affect a nursing infant. If you are nursing, closely monitor caffeine intake to make sure it is on the low side. High intake of caffeine can cause sleep problems, irritability, and increased bowel activity in breastfed infants. Anxiety : The caffeine in guarana might make feelings of anxiety worse. Bladder control problems : Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana might reduce bladder control, especially in older adults. If you need to urinate often with high urgency, use guarana cautiously. Bleeding disorders : There is some concern that the caffeine in guarana might make bleeding disorders worse. If you have a bleeding disorder, check with your healthcare provider before starting guarana. Diabetes : Guarana contains caffeine. Some research suggests that caffeine may affect the way the body uses sugar and might worsen diabetes. If you have diabetes, use guarana with caution and monitor your blood sugar closely. Diarrhea . Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea. Glaucoma . The caffeine in guarana increases the pressure inside the eye. The increase occurs within 30 minutes and lasts for at least 90 minutes after drinking caffeinated beverages. Heart disease : The caffeine in guarana might cause irregular heartbeat in certain people. Use with caution. High blood pressure : Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana might raise blood pressure. However, this effect might be less in people who consume caffeine regularly. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) : Guarana contains caffeine. The caffeine in guarana, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea and might make diarrhea from IBS worse. Seizures . Guarana contains caffeine. There is a concern that high doses of caffeine might cause seizures or decrease the effects of drugs used to prevent seizures. If you have seizures, talk to your healthcare provider before using guarana. Weak bones (Osteoporosis) : The caffeine in guarana can flush calcium out of the body through the kidneys. This calcium loss might weaken bones. If you have osteoporosis, don't consume more than 300 mg of caffeine per day. Taking calcium supplements may also help to replace any lost calcium. If you are generally healthy and getting enough calcium from your food or supplements, taking up to 400 mg of caffeine per day doesn't seem to increase the risk of getting osteoporosis.","Many of guarana’s effects are thought to be due to its high caffeine content. Caffeine’s effects include skeletal muscle, CNS, and cardiac stimulation, diuresis, increased blood pressure, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and hyperglycemia (2) (3).

Piperine might also kill fungi and parasites, and help the body absorb some drugs. Black pepper and white pepper both come from the same plant species, but they are made differently. Black pepper is made by cooking the dried unripe fruit. White pepper is made by cooking and drying the ripe seeds. People take black pepper by mouth for hay fever, asthma, upset stomach, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Black pepper is commonly eaten in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if using larger amounts of black pepper as a medicine is safe. When applied to the skin : Black pepper oil is possibly safe. It's usually well-tolerated, but if it gets into the eyes it can burn. Some people might develop an allergy to black pepper. When inhaled : Black pepper oil is possibly safe when used short-term. It might have a burning aftertaste and might upset the stomach. It might also cause cough. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Black pepper is commonly eaten in foods. But it is likely unsafe when taken by mouth in large amounts during pregnancy. It might cause an abortion. There isn't enough reliable information available to know if applying black pepper to the skin is safe or what the side effects might be. Breast-feeding : Black pepper is commonly eaten in foods.

DSI000066,L-Arginine,C0003765,"Arginine is an amino acid that is synthesized in the body. Oral arginine has been used for various conditions such as hypertension, angina, atherosclerosis, migraines, and erectile dysfunction. Its vasodilatory properties are thought responsible for beneficial effects. Arginine has also been used to enhance wound healing, immune function, and athletic performance. Some studies support the use of arginine in coronary artery and peripheral artery diseases , but long-term supplementation worsened PAD . In addition, oral supplementation in patients who had an acute myocardial infarction did not improve ejection fraction or vascular stiffness, and may be associated with higher mortality . A meta-analysis of arginine supplementation on markers for cardiovascular disease, obesity, or diabetes also did not find benefit, except perhaps in a select group of patients . Smaller studies suggest supplementation with arginine, glutamine, and HMB may benefit vascular endothelial function in older adults , but arginine supplementation alone did not improve blood flow or muscle performance in older women . In cancer patients, preliminary data are mixed for perioperative enteral arginine-enriched formulas to improve wound healing and immune function , but other studies suggest such formulas may reduce complications and length of hospital stay . However, early postoperative arginine-enriched feeding had no impact on long-term survival in patients undergoing surgery for oesophagogastric and pancreaticobiliary cancers , and a trial of an oral formula containing arginine, HMB, and glutamine to improve cachexia management in newly diagnosed lung cancer patients was halted due to slow accrual and partial adherence . Some data suggest a prophylactic arginine-containing supplement may reduce incidence of hand-foot syndrome in hepatocellular carcinoma patients taking sorafenib . Interestingly, arginine deprivation-based treatments are also being pursued as potential cancer treatments . Although a meta-analysis did not find significant effects with arginine supplementation on inflammatory biomarkers, subgroup analysis suggests it may increase circulating C-reactive protein in cancer patients, those older than age 60 or with higher baseline CRP levels, or with use of enteral formulas . Additional studies are needed to determine the circumstances under which arginine supplementation could be safe and effective. | L-arginine is an amino acid naturally found in red meat, poultry, fish, and dairy. It is necessary for making proteins and is commonly used for circulation. L-arginine is converted in the body into a chemical called nitric oxide. Nitric oxide causes blood vessels to open wider for improved blood flow. L-arginine also stimulates the release of growth hormone, insulin, and other substances in the body. It can be made in a lab and used in supplements. People use L-arginine for chest pain and various blood flow issues, erectile dysfunction, high blood pressure during pregnancy, and a serious disease in premature infants called necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It's also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these other uses.","When taken by mouth : L-arginine is possibly safe for most people when taken short-term. It can cause some side effects such as stomach pain, bloating, diarrhea, and low blood pressure. When applied to the skin : L-arginine is possibly safe for most people when used short-term. It's also possibly safe when used in a toothpaste short-term. When inhaled : L-arginine is possibly safe for most people when used short-term. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : L-arginine is possibly safe when taken by mouth for a short time during pregnancy. Not enough is known about using L-arginine long-term in pregnancy. Stay on the safe side and avoid long-term use. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if L-arginine is safe to use when breast-feeing. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : L-arginine is possibly safe in children when taken by mouth, when used in a toothpaste, or when inhaled. Guanidinoacetate methyltransferase deficiency (GAMT) : People with this inherited condition are unable to convert arginine and other similar chemicals into creatine. To prevent complications from this condition, avoid L-arginine supplements. Recent heart attack : L-arginine might increase the risk of death after a heart attack, especially in older people. If you have had a heart attack recently, don't take L-arginine. Kidney disease : L-arginine has caused high potassium levels when used by people with kidney disease. In some cases, this has resulted in a dangerous irregular heartbeat. Surgery : L-arginine might interfere with blood pressure control during and after surgery. Stop taking L-arginine at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Arginine is unique among amino acids for its vasodilatory properties (11). Arginine acts as a precursor for the synthesis of endogenous NO via the action of nitric oxide synthase. NO functions as a paracrine-signaling molecule mediating vasodilation and inhibition of platelet activation, monocyte and leucocyte adhesion, and smooth muscle cell proliferation. NO also helps to control vascular oxidative stress and redox-regulated gene expression (22). Arginine is also needed for the synthesis of creatine which is important in muscle contraction (22). In colorectal adenoma cells, arginine reduces the expression of survivin, an inhibitor of apoptosis, and induces iNOS expression (23).","L-arginine | Arginine PCA | L-Arginine nitrate | L-arginine | Meat, poultry, fish, dairy products, nuts, seeds, soy foods, legumes, and chocolate","L-arginine | 2-Amino-5-(diaminomethylidene amino) pentanoic acid, 2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic Acid, (2S)-2-Amino-5-{[amino (imino) methyl]amino}pentanoic Acid, (S)-2-Amino-5- Guanidinopentanoic Acid, Acide 2-Amino-5-Guanidinopentanoïque, Arg, Arginine, Arginine Aspartate, Arginine Ethyl Ester, Arginine Ethyl Ester Dihydrochloride, Arginine Ethyl Ester HCl, Arginine HCl, Arginine Hydrochloride, Di-Arginine Malate, Di-Arginine Orotate, Di-L-Arginine-L-Malate, Dl-Arginine, L-Arginina, L-Arginine Ethyl Ester Dichloride, L-Arginine HCl, L-Arginine Hexanoate, L-Arginine Hydrochloride, L-Arginine Ketoisocaproic Acid, L-Arginine L-Pyroglutamate, L-Arginine Pyroglutamate, L-Arginine Taurinate, Malate de Di-Arginine, Orotate de Di-Arginine, R-Gene 10.","L-Arginine | 5-Oxo-L-proline, compound with L-arginine (1:1) | Arginine PCA  | L-Arginine nitrate | (2S)-2-Amino-5-guanidinopentanoic acid (2S)-2-aminobutanedioate | Arginine | L-arginine | L-Arginine ethyl ester | Arginine silicate inositol",Arginine | Arginine Creatine | Arginine nitrate | Arginine malate | Arginine carglumate | Arginine orotate | Arginine silicate inositol | Arginine-L-malate | Arginine hydroxymethylbutyrate | Arginine silicate | L-Arginine,Arginine,L-Arginine
DSI000067,Tribulus terrestris,C0330899,"Tribulus is a perennial herb that grows in the subtropical regions of eastern and western Asia, southern Europe, and Africa. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine and in Ayurveda for chest pain, heart-related problems, dizziness, skin and eye disorders, to expel kidney stones, and as a diuretic and tonic. It is also marketed as a dietary supplement to enhance sexual function and for body building . Preclinical studies indicate that tribulus has analgesic , antihypertensive , anti-inflammatory , antiedematous , antioxidant , diuretic , hypoglycemic , antibacterial , antifungal , cardioprotective , and anticancer properties . Saponins in tribulus were reported to inhibit platelet aggregation, in vitro and to have antidepressive effects in a murine model . In a diabetic neuropathic pain model, a standardized tribulus extract was comparable to Pregabalin, with significant increases in pain threshold responses . Tribulus also increased sperm production , but its effects on modulating testosterone levels are mixed . In clinical studies, testosterone increases only occurred when tribulus was part of a combined supplement therapy, making it difficult to determine its contribution to this effect . Data on its benefits against erectile dysfunction are mixed . A pilot study evaluating tribulus in men with partial androgen deficiency showed significant differences in testosterone levels and erectile function, but no significant differences in levels of luteinizing hormone . In women, however, small studies indicate improvements in sexual dysfunction and improvements in hypoactive sexual desire disorder in pre- and postmenopausal subjects . In addition, formulations containing tribulus were found useful against bacterial vaginitis and for lowering blood pressure in prehypertensive individuals . A tribulus extract used alone did not not improve androgenic status or physical performance among athletes but may attenuate exercise-induced oxidative stress, muscle damage, and inflammation . Saponins in tribulus have shown activity against breast and prostate cancer cells , and may protect against UVB-induced carcinogenesis . In animal models, tribulus affected a significant reduction in tumor incidence, tumor burden, and cumulative number of papillomas , and relieved cisplatin-induced renal toxicity . Due to its purported hormonal activities, prostate cancer patients should consult with their physicians before using tribulus.",,"In vitro, cinnamic amides in tribulus fruits inhibit papain-like protease (PLpro), an essential proteolytic enzyme which plays a critical role in virus-mediated RNA replication (42). Di-p-coumaroylquinic acid derivatives in tribulus are associated with its antioxidant effects (43).
Aphrodisiac effects may be associated with the constituent protodioscin, which leads to an increase in some sex hormones (44). Erectogenic effects may also occur via conversion of protodioscin to DHEA (36) or by concentration-dependent relaxation of the corpus cavernosum (CC) via reactions in the nitric oxide (NO)/NO synthase pathway and CC endothelium (45) (25). The NO release effect may explain observed physiological responses to tribulus supplementation, independent of testosterone level (25). In a study conducted in rats with ovarian cysts, tribulus extract showed a luteinizing effect related to gonadotropin-like activity (20).
Saponins exhibit cytotoxic and antihyperlipidemic effects (42). They may protect against atherosclerosis by suppressing angiotensin II-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation via inhibition of intracellular ROS production, calcium ion mobilization, pkc-α expression, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and proto-oncogene expression (46). In ischemic cells, polyphenol-mediated antioxidant activity with tribulus extract resulted in significant suppression of LDH release, ROS generation, and superoxide production (29).
In animal models, tribulus exerts a protective effect in diabetic rats by inhibiting oxidative stress (6) and lowering levels of glycosylated hemoglobin and cholesterols (8). In diabetic neuropathic pain models, tribulus modulates oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine release in a dose-dependent manner via increases in superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and reduced glutathione and lipid peroxide levels (32). In chronic mild stress models, the attenuation of serum corticotropin-releasing factor and cortisol levels by tribulus saponins suggest normalization of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity (31). Antihypertensive effects occur via arterial smooth muscle relaxation, NO release, and membrane hyperpolarization (3). An aqueous extract also demonstrated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibition activity (2) that may help lower blood pressure. Phenolic acids such as chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid may be responsible for reputed cardioprotective properties (29).
Tribulus extracts induce apoptosis and suppress cancer cell proliferation by activating caspase 3, dephosphorylating extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1 and 2 (15), and by inhibiting nuclear factor (NF-kappa B) signaling (12). Saponins from tribulus inhibit multiple-drug resistance of cancer cells (11). In breast carcinoma cell lines, a saponin extract changed mRNA levels of CXCR4, CCR7 and BCL2 genes (38). In models of human prostate cancer, antitumor and antiangiogenic activities are attributed to cell-cycle arrest and apoptotic induction not involving the caspase pathway (39). Saponins also act as a modulator of apoptosis: in normal human keratinocytes, saponins attenuate UVB-induced programmed cell death through inhibition of intrinsic apoptotic pathway, but enhance apoptotic response in squamous cell carcinomas (40). The photoprotective effect of saponins is attributed to enhanced NER gene expression and inhibition of UVB-mediated NF-kappaB activation (40). In animal models, a hydroalcoholic extract of tribulus relieved cisplatin-induced renal toxicity, perhaps via diuretic effects that increase drug excretion, scavenging free radicals via increase in antioxidant enzymes, suppressing inflammatory agents, and acting on organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) proteins (41).
Tribulus extract was shown to limit formation of calcium oxalate and calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate crystals (21) (22), mineral compounds that can cause kidney stones.
Consumption of tribulus causes motor neuron adverse effects in animals by affecting the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors (18). The steroidal saponin diosgenin is thought to be responsible for hepatotoxic effects associated with tribulus (27).",Tribulus terrestris - Fruit,Caltrop | Puncture vine | Gokhru | Al-Gutub | Ba ji li,Tribulus terrestris | Tribulus terrestris - Fruit ,,Tribulus terrestris,

It is used in ayurvedic medicine as a demulcent, laxative, and to increase breast milk supply. It is also used as a dietary supplement to treat various conditions including diabetes, high cholesterol, wounds, inflammation, and gastrointestinal complaints.Preclinical studies suggest fenugreek has hypocholesterolemic , hypolipidemic , hypoglycemic , antimicrobial , hepatoprotective , and antinociceptive effects.Data in humans are limited. Small studies showed benefits of fenugreek for mild asthma , metabolic syndrome , as well as menopausal , postmenopausal , polycystic ovary syndrome symptoms , and Alzheimer’s disease . Data also suggest it may improve exercise performance , lipid parameters and glycemic control , and decrease insulin resistance in type-2 diabetic patients . More research is needed to confirm these effects .Fenugreek demonstrated chemopreventive and chemoprotective properties , but human studies have not been conducted. Fenugreek also acts as an estrogen receptor modulator and stimulates breast cancer cells in vitro , but evidence of its potential to stimulate lactation is limited . | Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) is an herb similar to clover. The seeds taste similar to maple syrup and are used in foods and medicine. Fenugreek is native to the Mediterranean, Europe, and Asia. Fenugreek seems to slow sugar absorption in the stomach and stimulate insulin. Both of these effects lower blood sugar in people with diabetes. Fenugreek might also improve levels of testosterone and estrogen, helping to improve interest in sex. People commonly use fenugreek for diabetes, menstrual cramps, sexual problems, enlarged prostate, high cholesterol, obesity, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Fenugreek is commonly consumed in foods. It is possibly safe when the powdered seed is taken for up to 3 years. Side effects may include diarrhea, stomach upset, bloating, and gas. It may also cause allergic reactions in some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Fenugreek is commonly consumed in foods. It is likely unsafe when used in greater amounts. It might cause malformations in the baby, as well as early contractions. Taking fenugreek just before delivery may cause the newborn to have an unusual body odor. This unusual body odor doesn't seem to be harmful, but it could be confused with a condition called ""maple syrup urine disease."" Breast-feeding : Fenugreek is possibly safe when taken by mouth to increase breastmilk flow. Taking fenugreek 1725 mg three times daily for 21 days doesn't seem to cause any side effects in infants. Children : Fenugreek is commonly consumed in foods. But there isn't enough reliable information to know if fenugreek is safe when taken in larger amounts. An unusual body and urine odor has been reported after drinking fenugreek tea. This doesn't seem to be harmful, but it could be confused with a condition called ""maple syrup urine disease."" Allergies : People who are allergic to other plants in the Fabaceae family, including soybeans, peanuts, green peas, and other legumes, might also be allergic to fenugreek. Surgery : Fenugreek might slow blood clotting. It might cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop taking fenugreek at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","The hypoglycemic activity of fenugreek may be associated with the galactomannan fiber and saponin components that reduce gastrointestinal glucose and cholesterol absorption, and increase bile acid excretion (14). 4-Hydroxyisoleucine, an amino acid constituent, potentiates insulin secretion in non-insulin-dependent diabetic rats when administered intraperitoneally (15). In addition to lower fasting and postprandial glucose levels, fenugreek-treated diabetic rats had higher hemoglobin, GSH, and plasma antioxidant levels and lower glycosylated hemoglobin, plasma lipids, and TBARS levels than diabetic controls (4). Dietary fenugreek also normalizes the activities of glucose and lipid-metabolizing enzymes in diabetic rats (3). Other animal studies suggest dietary fenugreek increases serum T4, liver GSH, glyoxalase I, and GST activities, and decreases T3 levels and T3/T4 ratio (17) (18) (19). In humans, fenugreek intake was associated with an increase in molar insulin binding sites of erythrocytes, which may enhance glucose utilization (16).Fenugreek has also been studied for its anticancer potential. In MCF-7 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells, a fenugreek extract induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (9). Dioscin, a steroidal saponin isolated from fenugreek, suppressed cell viability of ovarian cancer cells by regulating VEGFR2, PI3K, phosphorylated AKT and phosphorylated p38 MAPK signaling pathways (39).In a case report of serotonin syndrome likely caused by an interaction between fenugreek and sertraline, the authors point to animal studies that posit 4-hydroxyisoleucine may increase serotonin turnover in the brain (47).",Trigonella foenum-graecum - seed,"Bird's foot | Greek hayseed | Bockshornsame | Methi | Hu lu ba | Alholva, Bird's Foot, Bockshornklee, Bockshornsame, Chandrika, Egypt Fenugreek, Fenogreco, Fenugrec, Foenugraeci Semen, Foenugreek, Greek Clover, Greek Hay, Greek Hay Seed, Hu Lu Ba, Medhika, Methi, Methika, Sénégrain, Sénégré, Trigonella, Trigonella Foenum, Trigonella foenum-graecum, Trigonella foenugraecum, Trigonelle, Woo Lu Bar.",Trigonella foenum-graecum | Fenugreek,Fenugreek fiber | Fenugreek Fiber | Fenugreek,Fenugreek,Fenugreek

DSI000070,Boron,,"Boron is an element. Boron has been consumed for menstrual cramps and boric acid has been used vaginally for yeast infections, but evidence is limited. Boron seems to affect the way the body handles other minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus. It also seems to increase estrogen levels post-menopause. Boric acid, a common form of boron, can kill yeast that cause vaginal infections. Boron may have antioxidant effects. People commonly use boron for boron deficiency and vaginal yeast infections. It is also used for athletic performance, menstrual cramps, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Boron is likely safe when used in doses that don't exceed 20 mg daily. Boron is possibly unsafe when taken in higher doses. Doses over 20 mg daily might cause male fertility problems. Large doses can also cause poisoning. Signs of poisoning include irritability, tremors, weakness, headaches, diarrhea, vomiting, and other symptoms. When applied to the skin : Sodium pentaborate pentahydrate gel, which contains boron, is likely safe when applied to the skin for up to 5 weeks. When applied into the vagina : Boric acid, a common form of boron, is likely safe when used for up to 6 months. It can cause vaginal burning. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Boron is likely safe when taken by mouth during pregnancy or breast-feeding. For those 19-50 years old, do not take more than 20 mg daily; for those 14-18 years old, do not take more than 17 mg daily. Taking boron by mouth in higher doses is possibly unsafe and has been linked to lower birth weights and birth defects. Applying boric acid into the vagina during the first 4 months of pregnancy has also been linked to birth defects. Children : Boron is likely safe when used appropriately. The amount that is safe depends on the child's age. Boron is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in higher doses. Large quantities of boron can cause poisoning. Boric acid powder, a common form of boron, is possibly unsafe when applied in large amounts to prevent diaper rash. Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Boron might act like estrogen.

DSI000071,Calcium,C2936886,"Calcium is an essential mineral responsible for many physiological functions. It helps maintain bone structure and plays an important role in cell signaling and muscle contraction. Dietary sources of calcium include dairy products, dark greens, legumes, nuts and fish. Natural supplements are derived from minerals, oyster shells and occasionally corals.Calcium has been studied for a range of conditions including cardiovascular disease , osteoporosis , bone density loss , fracture prevention , premenstrual syndrome , pre-eclampsia , lead poisoning , and various cancers .Long-term supplement use was associated with an increased risk of coronary artery calcification and may lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD) , although findings remain debatable . In a Women’s Health Initiative sub-study, calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and hormone therapy yielded greater reductions in LDL-C than either intervention alone or placebo but supplementation did not always modify the effects of hormonal therapy on CVD events . Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may also benefit postmenopausal women who do not have pre-existing risk factors such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, or hypertension ; and large long-term studies in women did not find adverse cardiovascular associations with calcium supplementation , but a meta analysis reported an increase in the risk of CVD . High intake of supplements also increased cardiovascular mortality in men . Another study found supplementation to be associated with dementia in women following stroke , but dietary intake of vitamin D and calcium were reported useful in maintaining cognitive performance in older females .There is also conflicting evidence surrounding the benefits of calcium or calcium plus vitamin D supplements for bone health . The US Preventive Services Task Force did not find any associations between calcium plus vitamin D supplementation and reduced falls or fracture incidence in community-dwelling older adults without known deficiencies, osteoporosis, or history of fracture . In postmenopausal women, neither dietary calcium nor calcium plus vitamin D supplements reduced risk of hip fracture, although the latter study found significant reductions at 7 years . Subgroup analysis further suggested that supplementation along with estrogen therapy conferred additive protection against hip fractures . However, there appear to be no preventive benefits with supplementation for bone mineral density loss in breast cancer patients , in older adults , or in healthy men . But in a study of pediatric cancer survivors, hypocalcemia induced by standard osteoporotic medication was treated with continuous calcium supplementation . Calcium plus vitamin D also reduced bone density loss associated with antiretroviral therapy in HIV patients .In cancer settings, both dietary and supplemental calcium were linked with lower risk of colorectal cancer , with dietary calcium more beneficial in reducing the risk of incidence and recurrence of colorectal and advanced adenomas . Calcium intake was associated with increased risk for prostate cancer ; notably a genetic disposition for high intestinal absorption of calcium was reported in African-American men . Long-term studies suggest risks associated with calcium in prostate cancers are less strong when phosphorus intake is also considered . Data also suggest benefits against cutaneous metastases .In women, studies on calcium plus vitamin D supplements for reduced risk reported positive association with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) but conflicting data for colorectal cancers , all cancer types , and mortality . Other trials suggest benefits against hematologic but not invasive cancers . Available evidence is insufficient to assess benefits of calcium plus vitamin D supplementation for those receiving androgen deprivation therapy, aromatase inhibitors, or undergoing chemotherapy-induced menopause . Patients should consult with their oncologists or oncology healthcare teams, especially since calcium supplements can interact with a number of prescription medications.A balanced diet containing sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium and vitamin D is important to reduce risks for hypertension as well as cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events . But the risk-benefit ratio of supplementation is likely to vary, depending on dietary calcium intake, sex, age, ethnicity, and individual risks for cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis . In adults with normal calcium levels, genetic predisposition to higher serum levels does not affect bone mineral density nor protect against fractures . Intake of high-dose calcium supplements (>1 g/day) may actually increase the risk of ischemic stroke , and calcium plus vitamin D supplementation may elevate the risk for kidney stones . | Calcium is an essential nutrient found in many foods, such as dairy products. The bones and teeth contain over 99% of all calcium in the human body. Bones are always breaking down and rebuilding. Calcium is needed for this process, but the concentration of calcium in the body tends to decline with age. Taking extra calcium helps the bones rebuild and stay strong. The heart, nerves, and blood-clotting systems also need calcium. People commonly take calcium by mouth for the treatment and prevention of low calcium levels, muscle cramps, osteoporosis, softening of the bones, and PMS. It is also used for high blood pressure, cancer, stroke, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses. In the US and Canada, foods that contain calcium and vitamin D are allowed to state that they might reduce the risk of osteoporosis.","When taken by mouth : Calcium is likely safe when used in recommended amounts of about 1000-1200 mg daily. Calcium can cause some minor side effects such as belching or gas. But calcium is possibly unsafe when taken in doses above the daily tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL is 2500 mg for adults ages 19-50 years and 2000 mg for adults over 50 years. Taking more than this daily can increase the chance of having serious side effects. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Calcium is likely safe when taken by mouth in recommended amounts. But calcium is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in doses above the daily tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL is 3000 mg for those under 18 years of age and 2500 mg for those over 18 years of age. Higher doses might increase the risk of seizures in the infant. Be sure to consider total calcium intake from both dietary and supplemental sources of calcium. Avoid taking more than 1000-1200 mg of calcium from supplements daily unless prescribed by your doctor. Children : Calcium is likely safe when taken by mouth in recommended amounts. But calcium is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in doses above the daily tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL is 1000 mg for those 0-6 months old, 1500 mg for those 6-12 months old, 2500 mg for those 1-8 years old, and 3000 mg for those 9-18 years old. Children should consume enough calcium to meet daily requirements, but should not consume extra calcium. Low acid levels in the stomach (achlorhydria) : People with low levels of gastric acid absorb less calcium if calcium is taken on an empty stomach. People with low acid levels should take calcium supplements with meals. Too much calcium in the blood (as in parathyroid gland disorders and sarcoidosis) : Calcium should be avoided if you have a condition that causes high calcium levels. Taking calcium supplements can cause calcium levels to increase even more. Kidney disorders : In people with kidney disorders, taking calcium supplements can increase calcium levels too much. Speak with a healthcare provider before taking calcium supplements. Smoking : People who smoke absorb less calcium from the stomach and might require calcium supplements. Stroke : Taking calcium supplements for 5 or more years might increase the chance of developing dementia in people who have had a stroke. More research is needed to know if calcium supplements should be avoided after a stroke.","Calcium plays an important role in a variety of muscular, vascular, neurological, hormonal, and enzymatic reactions. Calcium reserves are found mostly in the bones, helping to maintain skeletal structure.The association of supplemental but not dietary calcium with increased cardiovascular risk could be related to their differing, acute effects on serum calcium (45). Supplementation may fail to compensate for renal calcium loss, resulting in increased circulatory calcium that could lead to coronary artery deposits (46). Reduced dietary intake may cause calcium depletion in membrane storage sites decreasing stability of vascular smooth muscle cell membranes, as optimal concentrations stabilize these membranes, inhibit calcium entry into cells, and reduce vasoconstriction (47). Gastrointestinal events associated with calcium supplements may also account for an increase in self-reported cardiovascular events (18).Observed associations of dairy with overall prostate cancer risk may be related to the modulation of vitamin D metabolism by calcium and phosphorus (15) (31). Saturated fat in whole dairy correlating with higher C-peptide concentrations, along with obesity and hyper-insulinemia, are proposed for associating whole milk with fatal prostate cancer (31). Other suggested mechanisms include increasing levels of ionized calcium in the blood, as prostate cancer cells express both calcium-sensing receptors and calcium-dependent voltage-gated channels, the stimulation of which by extracellular calcium increases prostate cancer cell growth (44) (35). In African American men, positive associations between calcium and aggressive prostate cancer have been linked to single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the CDX-2 binding site of the VDR gene (32).","Calcium carbonate | Bos taurus - Milk | Calcium iodide tetrahydrate | Calcium hydrogen phosphate dihydrate | Calcium caprylate | Calcium chloride | Calcium sulfate | Oyster shell | Calcium fluoride | Calcium hydroxyapatite | Calcium iodide | Milk, yogurt, cheese, egg, bread, salmon, prawns, sardines, shrimp, broccoli, spinach, kale, collards, spring greens, baked beans, chickpeas, lentils, kidney beans, soya beans, tofu, orange, almonds, sesame seeds and fortified cereals, orange juice and soy milk","Calcium carbonate | Calcium citrate | Calcium gluconate | Acétate de Calcium, Aspartate de Calcium, Bone Meal, Calcio, Calcio Quelado, Calcium Acetate, Calcium Aspartate, Calcium Carbonate, Calcium Chelate, Calcium Chélaté, Calcium Chloride, Calcium Citrate, Calcium Citrate Malate, Calcium D-Gluconate, Calcium Disuccinate, Calcium Gluconate, Calcium Glycerophosphate, Calcium Hydrogen Phosphate, Calcium Hydroxyapatite, Calcium Lactate, Calcium Lactogluconate, Calcium Orotate, Calcium Phosphate, Calcium Sulfate, Carbonate de Calcium, Chélate de Calcium, Chelated Calcium, Chlorure de Calcium, Citrate de Calcium, Citrate Malate de Calcium, Coquilles d'Huîtres Moulues, Coquilles d'œuf, Dicalcium Phosphate, Di-Calcium Phosphate, Dolomite, Egg Shell Calcium, Gluconate de Calcium, Glycérophosphate de Calcium, Heated Oyster Shell-Seaweed Calcium, Hydroxyapatite, Lactate de Calcium, Lactogluconate de Calcium, MCHA, MCHC, Microcrystalline Hydroxyapatite, Orotate de Calcium, Ossein Hydroxyapatite, Oyster Shell, Oyster Shell Calcium, Phosphate de Calcium, Phosphate de Calcium Hydrogène, Phosphate de di-Calcium, Phosphate Tricalcium, Poudre d'os, Quelato de Calcio, Sulfate de Calcium, Tricalcium Phosphate.",Calcium | Calcium Caseinate | Calcium iodatum | Calcium phosphoricum | Calcium di(octanoate) | Calcium chloride(CaCl2) | Calcium sodium phosphosilicate | Calcium sulfuricum | Calcium carbonicum Hahnemanni | Calcium Bisglycinate | Calcium fluoratum | Calcium hydroxyapatite | Calcium 2-oxopropanoate | Calcium jodatum | Calcium hypochlorite,Calcium d-Glucarate | Calcium fructopyranose borate | Calcium Formate | Calcium | Calcium hydroxymethylbutyrate | Calcium borate | Calcium Fructoborate | Calcium hydroxyisopcaproate | Calcium phytate | Calcium 2-aminoethylphosphate | Calcium fructate,Calcium,Calcium

DSI000074,Panax ginseng,C0086767,"A popular herb often confused with Asian or Panax ginseng, American ginseng has unique medicinal properties. It is frequently used in Chinese medicine to nourish “Yin” . American ginseng is also used in supplemental form to improve athletic performance, strength, and stamina, and to treat diabetes and cancer. Saponin glycosides, also known as ginsenosides or panaxosides, are thought responsible for its biological effects. In lab studies, ginsenosides have both stimulatory and inhibitory CNS effects , can alter cardiovascular tone, enhance humoral and cellular-dependent immunity, and exert anticancer effects . Other preclinical studies suggest enhanced anticancer activities when combined with antioxidants , synergistic effects with 5-fluorouracil , and protection against oxidative stress in irradiated human lymphocytes . Studies in humans are limited. Current data suggest that American ginseng may help improve glucose control in diabetics and that it is safe for long-term use . It has a modest effect in reducing number and severity of colds , and may enhance working memory . Findings from clinical trials on whether American ginseng can improve cancer-related fatigue are mixed , although a large multisite trial suggests benefit , and a systematic review/meta analysis reported efficacy of ginseng-containing formulas in reducing fatigue, but not ginseng alone . Epidemiological data suggest it may improve survival and quality of life in breast cancer patients , but more studies are needed. | Panax ginseng is an herb native to East Asia and Russia. It is also cultivated for its medicinal properties and the root is widely used as a “Yang” tonic in traditional medicine . Patients take ginseng to improve athletic performance, strength, and stamina, and as an immunostimulant. Some use it to treat diabetes, cancer, HIV/AIDS, and a variety of other conditions. Ginsenosides, the saponin glycosides, are thought responsible for medicinal effects of P. ginseng. They have both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on the CNS, alter cardiovascular tone, and increase humoral and cellular-dependent immunity . Studies in humans are limited. Although ginseng has been used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction , the effect may be trivial and the quality of evidence for most studies is low . Other preliminary data suggest it can be helpful for type II diabetic patients , but more studies are needed. Small studies suggest ginseng may enhance immune functioning in various populations or benefit patients with prehypertension or hypertension . It may also improve menopausal symptoms and markers for cardiovascular disease . Other data suggest ginseng helps alleviate idiopathic chronic fatigue and cold hypersensitivity of hands and feet in women . Ginseng has also been investigated for potential anticancer properties. Ginsenosides exhibit antiproliferative effects in vitro . Epidemiological data in breast cancer patients show improved survival and quality of life with ginseng use , and reduced risk of endometrial cancer in breast cancer survivors . In addition, two case-controlled studies indicate a positive association between consumption and reduction in the incidence of all cancers . In small randomized studies, ginseng reduced genotoxicity and improved quality of life in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer but did not relieve surgical menopause symptoms in those with gynecologic cancers . Also, ginseng did not alleviate fatigue in advanced cancer patients although a systematic review/meta analysis reported efficacy of ginseng-containing formulas in reducing fatigue, but not ginseng alone . Because ginseng was shown to have estrogenic effects , patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should consult their physicians before using it. Panax ginseng should not be confused with American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius) or Siberian ginseng (Eleutherococcus senticosus), which have different medicinal properties. It should also not be confused with Panax notoginseng which also has different properties , and is a key ingredient in the TCM formula Yunnan baiyao. | Panax notoginseng is a plant that grows in the mountains in Southwest China. Its root is sometimes used as medicine once it has grown for 3-5 years. Panax notoginseng might relax blood vessels, which might improve blood flow and reduce blood pressure. Some of the chemicals in Panax notoginseng might also reduce swelling and protect the heart. People use Panax notoginseng for chest pain, stroke, heart attack, bleeding, high blood pressure, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse Panax notoginseng with other plants with similar names, including Panax ginseng and American ginseng. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : Panax notoginseng is possibly safe when used for up to 6 weeks. It's usually well-tolerated. Side effects might include dry mouth, flushed skin, insomnia, nausea, and rash. When given in the rectum : There isn't enough reliable information to know if Panax notoginseng is safe or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Panax notoginseng is likely unsafe when taken by mouth while pregnant or breast-feeding. One of the chemicals in Panax notoginseng has caused birth defects in animals. Avoid use. Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Panax notoginseng might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use Panax notoginseng.","Ginsenosides are thought responsible for American ginseng’s activity, although the exact mechanism of action is unknown. Related species, such as Panax ginseng, have been the focus of most laboratory and clinical research. Experiments using extracts from these species indicate that ginsenosides stimulate and inhibit the central nervous system (4). The extracts also stimulate TNF alpha production by alveolar macrophages (10).
The Rg1 ginsenoside present in American ginseng is associated with improvements in humoral and cell-mediated immune response and increases in T helper cells, T lymphocytes, and NK cells in mice (5). American ginseng was also shown to lower serum glucose and may affect carbohydrate metabolism (2) (6).
Several ginsenosides have demonstrated anticancer properties in vitro (3). Current data suggest that antiproliferative effects of American ginseng are due to compound K, a metabolite of the ginsenoside Rb1, but not Rb1 as previously thought (22). In a rodent study, the herb significantly attenuated colon carcinogenesis by reducing tumor number and load, and was associated with suppression of proinflammatory cytokine activation (26). | Animal studies suggest ginsenosides prolong drug-induced sleeping time in mice and exhibit additional depressant effects on the CNS (2). In addition, the ginsenoside Rb1 improves acetylcholine release and enhances postsynaptic uptake of choline (2). In other animal studies, ginseng saponins lowered total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels (15). Ginseng may improve NO synthesis in endothelium of the heart, lung, kidneys, and in the corpus cavernosum (13).
In humans, oral intake of ginseng reduced post-exercise muscle injury and inflammation marked by reduced creatine kinase, beta-glucuronidase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (14).
Anticancer activity has been observed in vitro with several ginsenosides. Differentiation of HL-60 promyelocytic cells was induced in ginsenosides Rh2- and Rh3-treated cells (2). Rg3 exerted effects in part by blocking the nuclear translocation of the protein ß-catenin in colon cancer cells, most of which turned cancerous via activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway (25). Rp1 reduced breast cancer cell proliferation by decreasing stability of the insulin like growth factor 1 receptor protein in breast cancer cells (26).",Panax ginseng - root | Panax ginseng - root | Root | Root | Root,"Xi yang shen | Western ginseng | Five-fingers | Chinese ginseng | Ren shen | Korean ginseng | Red ginseng | Aralia quinquefolia var. notoginseng, Chai-Jen-Shen,  Field Seven, Noto-Gin, Notoginseng, Panax notoginseng, Panax Notoginseng Radix, Panax pseudoginseng var. notoginseng Radix Notoginseng, Samch'il, Sanchitongtshu, San Qi, San Qui, San-Qi Ginseng, Sanchi, Sanchi Ginseng, Sanchitongtshu, Sanqi,  Sanqi Powder,  Sanshichi, Three Seven, Tian Qi, Tian San Qi, Tienchi, Tienchi Ginseng.",Panax ginseng | Panax ginseng C.A.

It is used in traditional medicine as a diuretic, laxative, stimulant, aphrodisiac and for treating diabetes and venereal diseases. Damiana showed anxiolytic , antidepressant , hypoglycemic , anti-ulcer as well as cytotoxic effects; and stimulated sexual behavior in preclinical models. Whether it has estrogenic effects is not clear as findings are mixed . Small studies suggest formulations containing damiana may induce weight loss and produce short-term effects on caloric intake in overweight adults, improve menopausal symptoms , and sexual function in post-menopausal women . Confirmatory research is needed. Of note, damiana is used in the botanical formulation ArginMax , which is marketed as a treatment for female sexual dysfunction. | Damiana is a wild shrub that grows in Mexico, Central America, and the West Indies.

Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if damiana is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Diabetes : Damiana might affect blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. Watch for signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and monitor your blood sugar carefully if you have diabetes and use damiana. Surgery : Since damiana seems to affect blood glucose levels, there is a concern that it might interfere with blood glucose control during and after surgery. Stop using damiana at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Damiana’s anti-ulcer activity is believed to be due to the inhibition of lipid peroxidation, immuno modulation and antioxidant effects of its major constituent, arbutin (15). In other studies, a damiana extract and pinocembrin and acacetin, compounds derived from the herb, suppressed aromatase activity. Other compounds including apigenin 7-glucoside, Z-echinacin and pinocembrin demonstrated estrogenic activity (12).The pro-sexual activity of damiana was shown to involve the nitric oxide pathway, with the anxiolytic property of the herb thought to contribute to such effects (14).",Leafy twigs | Leaves | Leaf,"

DSI000093,Hypericum perforatum,C0813171,"St. John’s wort is a perennial herb indigenous to Europe, West Asia, and North Africa, and now prevalent in many parts of the world. The flowering tops are reputed for their medicinal properties and the herb has a centuries-long history as a remedy for headaches, kidney problems, and nerve disorders. St. John’s Wort was also used by Native Americans for wound healing, snakebites, and diarrhea. Today it is used in several European countries as an antidepressant, and to treat anxiety, sleep problems, and seasonal affective disorder. It is also marketed in the US as a dietary supplement to support emotional well-being. St. John’s wort is one of the most extensively studied herbs, with active constituents hyperforin and hypericin being the focus of most research. Lab studies show that it has neuroprotective properties and may relieve neuropathic pain . Clinical studies suggest St. John’s wort may be as effective as SSRIs such as paroxetine , fluoxetine and citalopram for mild to moderate depression. It was also shown to be a cost-effective alternative to generic antidepressants . Reductions in depression were sustained as well with continued use . However, data are inconsistent when all types of depression are analyzed and some randomized trials have found St. John’s wort ineffective for both major and minor depression . A few studies suggest efficacy with St. John’s wort for premenstrual syndrome and vasomotor symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women . It may also enhance the effect of clopidogrel in patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention , but more studies are needed. Its use did not improve symptoms in children and adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder . St. John’s wort has many documented interactions with conventional drugs resulting in reduced efficacy or treatment failure, as well as several associated adverse effects. Its use may also cause photosensitivity and has been associated with increased risk of cataracts . Therefore, patients should speak with their physician or pharmacist before using this product. | St. John's wort is a plant native to Europe with yellow, star-shaped flowers. It's often used for depression but can cause serious interactions with some drugs. St. John's wort is named after John the Baptist. The plant usually begins to flower around the 24th of June, the feast day of St. John the Baptist. It contains many chemicals that act on messengers in the brain that regulate mood. People most commonly use St. John's wort for depression and mood disorders. There is some strong scientific evidence that it is effective for mild to moderate depression. St. John's wort is also used for symptoms of menopause and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses. St. John's wort is available in dietary supplements in the US. But France has banned its use in products because of drug interaction concerns. In other countries, St. John's wort is only available with a prescription.","When taken by mouth : St. John's wort is likely safe when used in doses up to 900 mg daily for up to 12 weeks. It can cause some side effects such as diarrhea, dizziness, trouble sleeping, restlessness, and skin tingling. St. John's wort interacts with many drugs. Let your healthcare provider know if you want to take St. John's wort. St. John's wort is possibly unsafe when taken in large doses. It might cause severe skin reactions after sun exposure. Wear sun block outside, especially if you are light-skinned. When applied to the skin : St. John's wort is possibly safe when it is applied to the skin once a week for four weeks. However, St. John's wort might cause severe skin reactions after sun exposure. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : St. John's wort is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. Taking St. John's wort while pregnant might cause birth defects in infants. Until more is known, don't use St. John's wort when pregnant. Breast-feeding : St. John's wort is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth while breast-feeding. Infants can experience colic, drowsiness, and fussiness. Until more is known, don't use St. John's wort when breast-feeding. Children : St. John's work is possibly safe when taken by mouth for up to 8 weeks in children 6-17 years-old. Alzheimer disease : St. John's wort might make dementia worse in people with Alzheimer disease. Bipolar disorder : St. John's wort can bring on mania in people with bipolar disorder, and can also speed up the cycling between depression and mania. Depression : In people with major depression, St. John's wort might bring on mania, which can involve impulsive behavior. Schizophrenia : St. John's wort might bring on psychosis in some people with schizophrenia. Surgery : St. John's wort might affect serotonin levels in the brain, which could interfere with surgical procedures. Also, in people who have used St. John's wort, using anesthesia may lead to serious heart complications during surgery. Stop using St. John's wort at least two weeks before a scheduled surgery.","In vitro studies suggest hypericum inhibits serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake by neurons (22) (23). Although earlier data suggested MOA inhibition, additional findings were insignificant in vivo (24). More recently hyperforin, the main constituent associated with serotonin reuptake inhibition, activated transient receptor potential C6 channels in vitro inducing neurite outgrowth and possibly influencing monoamine uptake (25), and stimulated development and function of oligodendrocytes (26). Hypericin suppresses voltage-dependent calcium channel and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity and evokes glutamate release, adding further clues to its function in the brain (27).
Hypericin-induced phototoxicity appears to be oxygen-dependent and may involve intracellular pH reduction or mediation by TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor systems (28). Incidental reporting also suggests photoactivated hypericin can cause demyelination of cutaneous axons (29).
Mechanisms by which St. John’s wort induces or modulates different enzymes and alters pharmacokinetics of corresponding drug substrates continue to be evaluated. Hyperforin induces CYP3A4 through activation of the pregnane X receptor (30) and St. John’s wort extract modulates UGT and P-gp activity via protein kinase C (31) (32). Analgesic and CNS activity may be due to its bioflavonoid content (21) as well as through inhibition of protein kinase C isoforms and their phosphorylation (2).
The enolized beta-dicarbonyl system contained in hyperforin may play a central role in its antiangiogenic activity, but chemical and metabolic instability of hyperforin itself has led to the search for more stable derivatives (33). In animal models, hyperforin and its stabilized derivative aristoforin suppress lymphatic endothelial cell growth and lymphangiogenesis by inducing cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (34). Hyperforin also reversed P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein activity in human myeloid leukemia cell lines (35). It exerts neuroprotective effects in PC12 cells via AKT/GSK-3β signal regulation to decrease aluminum-induced Aβ production and tau phosphorylation (82).",Hypericum perforatum - herb top,"Saint John's wort | Hypericum | Goatweed | God's wonder plant | Witches herb | Amber, Amber Touch-and-Heal, Barbe de Saint-Jean, Chasse-diable, Demon Chaser, Fuga Daemonum, Goatweed, Hardhay, Herbe à la Brûlure, Herbe à Mille Trous, Herbe Aux Fées, Herbe Aux Mille Vertus, Herbe Aux Piqûres, Herbe de Saint Éloi, Herbe de la Saint-Jean, Herbe du Charpentier, Herbe Percée, Hierba de San Juan, Hypereikon, Hyperici Herba, Hypericum perforatum, Klamath Weed, Millepertuis, Millepertuis Perforé, Rosin Rose, Saynt Johannes Wort, SJW, Tipton Weed.",Hypericum perforatum,St. John's Wort,St. John's Wort,St. John's Wort

DSI000096,Niacin,C0027996,"Niacin is a form of vitamin B3 made in the body from tryptophan. It's found in many foods including meat, fish, milk, eggs, green vegetables, and cereals. Niacin is required for the proper function of fats and sugars in the body and to maintain healthy cells. At high doses, niacin might help people with heart disease because of its effects on blood clotting. It might also improve levels of fats called triglycerides in the blood. Prescription forms of niacin are approved by the US FDA for abnormal cholesterol levels and for preventing vitamin B3 deficiency and related conditions such as pellagra. People use niacin supplements for metabolic syndrome, heart disease, cataracts, high blood pressure, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses. Do not confuse niacin with NADH, niacinamide, inositol nicotinate, IP-6, or tryptophan. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : Niacin is likely safe for most people when used appropriately. Prescription products containing niacin are safe when taken as directed. Niacin-containing foods or niacin supplements are safe when taken in doses lower than 35 mg daily. A common side effect of niacin is a flushing reaction. This might cause burning, itching, and redness of the face, arms, and chest, as well as headaches. Starting with small doses and taking 325 mg of aspirin before each dose of niacin may help. This reaction usually goes away as the body gets used to niacin. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Niacin is likely safe when taken by mouth while pregnant and breast-feeding. The maximum recommended amount of niacin while pregnant or breast-feeding is 30 mg daily in those under 18 years of age, and 35 mg daily for those 19 years and older. Children : Niacin is likely safe when taken by mouth in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) by age. The UL is 10 mg for children 1-3 years of age, 15 mg for children 4-8 years of age, 20 mg for children 9-13 years of age, and 30 mg for children 14-18 years of age. Allergies : Niacin might worsen allergies by causing histamine to be released. Histamine is the chemical responsible for allergic symptoms. Chest pain (angina) : Niacin should be used cautiously in people with angina. Diabetes : Niacin might increase blood sugar. People with diabetes who take niacin should check their blood sugar carefully. Gallbladder disease : Niacin might make gallbladder disease worse. Gout : Large amounts of niacin might increase the risk for gout. Kidney disease : Niacin might accumulate in people with kidney disease. This might cause harm. Liver disease : Taking high doses of niacin might increase liver damage. Don't use large amounts if you have liver disease. Low blood pressure : Taking niacin in high doses might lower blood pressure and worsen this condition. Stomach or intestinal ulcers : Niacin might make ulcers worse. Don't use large amounts if you have ulcers. Surgery : Niacin might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Speak with your healthcare provider about whether you should stop taking niacin before a scheduled surgery. Fatty deposits around tendons (tendon xanthomas) : Niacin might increase the risk of infections in xanthomas. Thyroid disorders : Thyroxine is a hormone produced by the thyroid gland.

Systematic reviews suggest it is as effective as quinine , but increased risk of relapse may limit its uses . It is also unclear whether it is effective against quinine-resistant malaria strains. Other reports of artemisinin-based therapy resistance are also emerging, prompting additional drug development .Studies of artemisia for other conditions are limited. In one RCT, a low-dose artemisia formulation produced clinically relevant pain reductions in patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis . A subsesquent open-label continuation study demonstrated long-term safety with improvements maintained at 6 months . Artemisia improved symptoms in patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis but did not produce any clinical benefits in patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy . A few safety studies in advanced cancer patients suggest oral add-on artesunate, a semisynthetic artemisinin derivative, is well tolerated, although monitoring for ototoxicity is needed . In other studies, oral or intravenous artesunate did not produce a response , although modest clinical activity was observed with intravenous administration . More studies are needed to determine the conditions under which compounds derived from artemisia may be safe and effective. | Sweet Annie (Artemisia annua) is a plant used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). The parts that grow above the ground are used to make medicine. Sweet Annie contains a chemical called artemisinin, which seems to act against the parasites that cause malaria. Some drug manufacturers make anti-malarial drugs from artemisinin that they have modified in the lab. People use Sweet Annie for hay fever, malaria, osteoarthritis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse Sweet Annie with Artemisia herba-alba, mugwort, wormseed, or wormwood. These are not the same. Also, the chemical made from Sweet Annie that is used in prescription drugs for malaria is not covered in this summary.","When taken by mouth : Sweet Annie is possibly safe when used short-term. Side effects might include upset stomach and vomiting. Liver damage has also been reported in a small number of people taking Sweet Annie tea or extracts. When placed under the tongue : Sweet Annie is possibly safe when used for up to 32 weeks. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if Sweet Annie is safe or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if Sweet Annie is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Allergy to ragweed and related plants : Sweet Annie may cause an allergic reaction in people who are sensitive to the Asteraceae/Compositae family. Members of this family include ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many others. Liver problems : Sweet Annie might cause liver problems, even in healthy people. Taking Sweet Annie might make liver problems worse. People with a history of liver problems should avoid taking Sweet Annie.","Artemisinin, the active constituent of A. annua, exerts antimalarial effects by free radicals formed via cleavage of the endoperoxide bond in its structure, which are responsible for eradicating the Plasmodium species (23).Artemisinin induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest of Leishmani donovani promastigotes (8). It has antiproliferative effects on medullary thyroid carcinoma cells (2), and induces apoptosis in a lung cancer cell line by modulating p38 and calcium signaling (14). In another study, it significantly inhibited cell growth and proliferation, and caused G1 cell-cycle arrest in neuroblastoma cell lines (25). Dihydroartemisinin, a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin, demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity by attenuating COX-2 production via downregulation of serine/threonine kinase and MAPK pathways  (24). Recent findings suggest that dihydroartemisinin-triggered apoptosis in colorectal cells occurs through the ROS-mediated mitochondria-dependent pathway (26).",Herb top,"Qing Hao | Sweet sagewort | Sweet wormwood | Annual wormwood | Absinthe Sauvage, Ajenjo Silvestre, Annual Mugwort, Annual Wormwood, Armoise Amère, Armoise Annuelle, Artémise, Artemisia annua, Artemisia, Artemisinin, Chinese Wormwood, Ching-hao, Herba Artemisiae Annuae, Herbe aux Cent Goûts, Huang Hua Guo, Qing Hao, Qinghaosu, Sourcil de Lune, Sweet Sagewort, Sweet Wormwood.",Artemisia annua,Sweet Annie,Artemisia annua,Sweet Annie

Women take German ipecac to treat painful menstrual periods. Some people apply German ipecac directly to the skin in a warm compress (poultice) for healing swelling and bruising. | Ipecac is a small shrub. It grows in parts of Central America and Brazil. The root is used to make medicine. Ipecac syrup is available both as a nonprescription product and as an FDA-approved prescription product. But using ipecac can be unsafe when used long-term or in large amounts. Ipecac is most commonly used to cause vomiting after suspected poisoning. It is also used for croup, severe diarrhea, and cancer, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any of these uses.","German ipecac might be UNSAFE to take by mouth. It can cause vomiting, breathing problems, paralysis, heart stoppage, and other problems. There isn’t enough information to know whether it is safe to apply German ipecac directly to the skin. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : German ipecac might be UNSAFE for anyone to take. If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, concern for you baby’s health gives you extra reasons not to use it. | When taken by mouth : Ipecac 15-30 mL is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when taken one time as a single dose. It can cause nausea, vomiting, stomach irritation, dizziness, low blood pressure, shortness of breath, and a fast heartbeat. Ipecac is LIKELY UNSAFE when taken by mouth long-term or in doses greater than 30 mL. Misuse of ipecac can lead to serious poisoning, heart damage, and death. Signs of poisoning include difficulty breathing, digestive tract problems, abnormal heart rates, blood in the urine, convulsions, shock, coma, and death. When applied to the skin : Ipecac is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when allowed to touch the skin. Ipecac contains emetine, which can irritate the skin. When inhaled : Ipecac is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when inhaled.

Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if ipecac is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Ipecac is POSSIBLY SAFE for children when used appropriately as a prescription product to induce vomiting. But the American Academy of Pediatrics' recommendation to keep a 1-ounce bottle of syrup of ipecac at home has recently been reversed. The new statement reads, ""Syrup of ipecac should no longer be routinely used as a poison treatment intervention in the home."" The thinking is that keeping ipecac at home hasn't been proven to save lives. Talk with your healthcare provider or poison control center about how to use ipecac correctly in cases of poisoning in children. Ipecac is LIKELY UNSAFE when used in high doses or in children under the age of one year. Children are more sensitive than adults to the side effects of ipecac.

Among patients with sickle cell anemia, treatment with glutamine resulted in significantly fewer pain crises .In oncology settings, studies suggest glutamine or its derivatives are useful against peripheral neuropathy , mucositis , fluorouracil-induced GI toxicity and FOLFOX-induced diarrhea . Intravenous glutamine also reduced chemotherapy-induced nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea in patients with gastric or colorectal cancer , and enteral nutrition that includes arginine, glutamine, and omega-3 fatty acids may improve short-term survival in stage IV gastric cancer patients . Preliminary data on a supplement containing HMB, L-arginine and glutamine suggest it may help prevent sorafenib-associated hand-foot skin reactions in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma . In addition, perioperative diet containing arginine, glutamine, and fish oil led to reductions in mucocutaneous fistula and length of hospital stay in clean-contaminated head and neck cancer surgery patients . Glutamine alone also reduced length of hospital stay in patients with colorectal cancer . But findings from cachexia trials are mixed .Other studies suggest glutamine may reduce radiation morbidity in breast cancer patients and treatment-induced mucositis and dysphagia in patients with oropharynx and larynx carcinoma , and delay esophagitis onset in non-small cell lung cancer patients . However, meta-analyses report lack of strong evidence with glutamine for oral mucositis , for radiation dermatitis or for radiation-associated gastrointestinal toxicity , a systematic review cited the need for well-designed trials , and conflicting data indicate no impact on postsurgical complications or infections in cancer patients , nor on acute radiation-induced esophagitis in patients with advanced thoracic malignancies . Furthermore, findings also suggest a role for glutamine in tumor cell growth and maintenance . More research is needed to resolve these ambiguities.In pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, glutamine may have benefits against oral mucositis and chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy . | Glutamine is the most abundant amino acid found in the body. It's made in the muscles and transferred by the blood into different organ systems. Glutamine is a building block for making proteins in the body. It's also needed to make other amino acids and glucose. Glutamine supplements might help gut function, immune function, and other processes, especially in times of stress when the body uses more glutamine. People take glutamine for sickle cell disease, burns, to improve recovery after surgery, for injuries, and for complications of HIV/AIDS. It is also used for diarrhea, cystic fibrosis, obesity, lung cancer, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses. Glutamine (Endari) is approved by the US FDA as a prescription drug for sickle cell disease.","When taken by mouth : Glutamine is likely safe when used in doses up to 40 grams daily. Side effects are generally mild and might include bloating, nausea, dizziness, heartburn, and stomach pain. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Glutamine is consumed as part of the diet. There isn't enough reliable information to know if glutamine is safe to use in larger amounts as a medicine when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Glutamine is likely safe when taken by mouth in doses up to 0.7 grams/kg body weight daily. There isn't enough reliable information to know if higher doses of glutamine are safe. Liver disease : Glutamine can increase the risk for brain function issues in people with advanced liver disease. Do not use it if you have liver disease. Bipolar disorder : Glutamine might increase the risk for mania or hypomania in people with this condition. Monosodium glutamate (MSG) sensitivity : If you are sensitive to MSG, you might also be sensitive to glutamine. The body converts glutamine to glutamate. Seizures : There is some concern that glutamine might increase the likelihood of seizures in some people. Avoid use.","Glutamine is essential for the maintenance of intestinal mucosal integrity and function (1). It maintains immune function by serving as the principle metabolic fuel for cells, acts as a precursor for protein synthesis, and along with cysteine and glycine, is involved in glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Intravenous glutamine preserves liver and intestinal glutathione stores in animal models of oxidant damage. Glutamine is also involved in nitrogen exchange, as it neutralizes and eliminates excess ammonia formed during protein catabolism. As a nitrogen donor, it contributes to the synthesis of other non-essential amino acids, including the purines and pyrimidines, and is therefore essential for the proliferation of most cells (29). It also plays a supportive role during biochemical stress and sepsis. Reduced oxidative stress and sickle cell-related pain with l-glutamine is attributed to increased proportions of the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides in sickle cell erythrocytes (35).Although the mechanism underlying benefits against cachexia is unclear, it is thought that glutamine, a modulator of protein turnover, enhances net protein synthesis (11). Clinical evidence suggests that total parenteral nutrition supplemented with glutamine improves nitrogen balance, maintains the intracellular glutamine pool, enhances protein synthesis, and prevents deterioration of gut permeability in post-surgery patients (12).Glutamine prevented genotoxic and clastogenic damages caused by cisplatin in mice (30). It may also potentiate the tumoricidal effect of methotrexate (MTX) since polyglutamation of MTX impairs its efflux from tumor cells and reduces its accumulation in the gut (31). The supplemental intravenous form leads to increases of GSH in the gut, but not in tumors, in a sarcoma-bearing rat model.However, other findings show that glutamine transporters are upregulated in tumor cells and that glutamine acts as a mitochondrial substrate and promotes protein translation. This indicates tumor cell dependence for growth and maintenance (26). In addition, glutamine helps cancer cells survive acidic stress through enzymatic deamidation rather than provide nutrition (27).","L-Glutamine | L-Glutamine | Alanylglutamine | L-Alany-L-glutamine | Wheat, corn, barley, peanuts, soybeans, egg whites, and milk","L-Glutamine | GLN | Acide Glutamique, Acide Glutamique HCl, Acide L-(+)-2-Aminoglutaramique, Acide L-Glutamique, Acide L-Glutamique HCl, Alanyl-L-Glutamine Dipeptide, Éthyle Ester de Glutamine, Éthyle Ester de Glutamine HCl, GLN, Glutamate, Glutamic Acid, Glutamic Acid HCl, Glutamina, Glutaminate, Glutamine Ethyl Ester, Glutamine Ethyl Ester HCl, Glutamine Methyl Ester, Glutamine Peptides, Levoglutamide, Levoglutamine, L-(+)-2-Aminoglutaramic Acid, L-Alanyl-L-Glutamine, L-Glutamic Acid, L-Glutamic Acid HCl, L-Glutamic Acid Hydrochloride, L-Glutamic Acid 5-Amide, L-Glutamine, N-Acetyl-L-Glutamine, Peptides de Glutamine, Q, (S)-2,5-Diamino-5-oxopentanoic Acid.","L-Glutamine | Glutamine peptides | (S)-2,5-Diamino-5-oxopentanoic acid | L-Alany-L-Glutamine | L-Alany-L-glutamine | L-Glutamine or 2 - aminoglutaramic acid | L-(+)-2-Aminoglutaramic acid | L-2-Aminoglutaramic acid | (2S)-2-amino-4-carbamoyl-butanoic acid | (2S)-2-Aminoglutaramic acid | 2-aminoglutaramic acid",Creatine glutamine | Creatyl-L-glutamine | Glycyl-L-glutamine | Glutamine | Glutamine alpha-ketogutarate | Glutamine (various) | Glutamine nitrate | Glycine-alanyl-lysine-l-glutamine | Glycyl-Glutamine-L-Valine | Glutamine precursor (unspecified) | Glyceryl-L-glutamine | L-Alanyl-Glutamine | N-acetyl glutamine,Glutamine,Glutamine
DSI000159,L-Phenylalanine,C0031453,"Phenylalanine is an amino acid. There are three forms: L-, D-, and DL- phenylalanine. L-phenylalanine is found naturally in foods such as meat and eggs. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein. L-phenylalanine is an essential amino acid. It is the only form of phenylalanine found in proteins. D-phenylalanine is not an essential amino acid, and its role in the body is not currently understood. DL-phenylalanine is made in a lab. People use phenylalanine for a disorder that causes white patches to develop on the skin (vitiligo). It is also used for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic pain, aging skin, depression, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.","When taken by mouth : L-phenylalanine is commonly consumed in foods. L-phenylalanine, D-phenylalanine, and DL-phenylalanine are possibly safe when used as medicine, short-term. 
Side effects might include anxiety, headache, and constipation. When applied to the skin : Phenylalanine cream is possibly safe when used short-term. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : L-phenylalanine is commonly consumed in foods. But having too much phenylalanine during pregnancy can increase the chance of birth defects. For patients who process phenylalanine normally and have normal levels, it is fine to consume phenylalanine in typical food amounts, but supplements containing phenylalanine should be avoided. For pregnant patients who have high levels of phenylalanine, such as those with a condition called phenylketonuria (PKU), even normal food amounts are unsafe. For these patients, experts recommend a low phenylalanine diet for at least 20 weeks before getting pregnant. This should reduce the risk of birth defects. Breast-feeding : L-phenylalanine is commonly consumed in foods. But there isn't enough reliable information to know if any form of phenylalanine is safe to use in larger amounts as medicine while breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Phenylketonuria (PKU) and other conditions that cause high levels of phenylalanine : Some people have inherited disorders, such as PKU, that cause their bodies to build up too much phenylalanine. This can cause developmental delay, high blood pressure, stroke, and many other serious health issues. If you have one of these disorders, avoid phenylalanine supplements.

DSI000161,Magnesium,C3540792,"Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in numerous biochemical processes, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, cellular signal transduction, DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, and bone formation . It also helps regulate blood pressure and enzymes such as those that control intracellular calcium and potassium, and is essential for normal heart functioning . The dietary form can be found in many foods, especially dark green leafy vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits, and fish .In dietary supplements, over-the-counter products, and pharmaceutical preparations, magnesium is combined with another substance such as a salt or acid, and has specific therapeutic uses. The carbonate, hydroxide, and oxide forms are found in antacid and laxative products whereas citrate is used as a laxative before diagnostic procedures or surgery of the colon. The chloride, gluconate, lactate, and sulfate forms are clinically used to treat magnesium deficiency.Both dietary and supplemental forms have been studied widely for their potential role to reduce risk of chronic ailments including cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Among colorectal cancer patients, adequate magnesium intake through diet and/or supplements along with vitamin D status was associated with lower mortality risk . Other studies have not linked dietary/supplement consumption with cancer incidence and mortality , or pancreatic cancer risk , but have associated higher intake with a lower risk for colorectal tumors and lung cancer . Additionally, both low and high plasma levels were associated with an increased incident risk of cancer in hypertensive adults .Dietary intake is also associated with reduced mortality from cardiovascular disease and sudden cardiac death (SCD), although studies may be more affirmative for serum magnesium on SCD . Other studies on magnesium intake suggest increased survival in patients with heart failure , reduced stroke risk , and benefits with supplementation on endothelial function . Some studies have shown a reduction in blood pressure following supplementation , and a meta-analysis also suggests antihypertensive effects . However, data from a large community-based cohort did not show low serum levels to be a risk factor for developing hypertension or cardiovascular disease . Other small studies suggest it may help patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis .Magnesium intake has demonstrated benefits against metabolic disorders including diabetes , and a meta-analysis also suggests supplementation may benefit those with or at risk of diabetes . In other studies, positive effects were observed on bone mass accrual in healthy adolescents and bone turnover in postmenopausal osteoporotic women , while deficiencies have been linked to osteoporosis .There is moderate evidence for use of magnesium in migraine headaches and as prophylaxis , but studies of dietary or supplemental magnesium on depression are conflicting . Although preliminary data show mixed results with oral supplementation for premenstrual syndrome , a pilot study indicates that it reduces menopausal hot flashes in breast cancer patients . Supplementation does not appear to reduce leg cramps in older adults , but a systematic review found it may help leg cramps during pregnancy . Larger studies are needed to elucidate conflicting results and clarify the roles for supplementation across various health conditions.Many adults, particularly African-Americans and the elderly , may not have adequate dietary intakes of magnesium. However, true deficiency most often occurs with critical illness including cardiac conditions and preeclampsia, as well as gastrointestinal and renal conditions, poorly-controlled diabetes, and alcoholism . In addition, certain medications including calcineurin inhibitors , high-dose antivirals , and the long-term use of proton pump inhibitors , as well as some cancer therapy regimens and surgical procedures , may also cause hypomagnesemia. If deficiency is suspected, patients should be evaluated by their treating physician to determine the extent of inadequate intake and its effective management, as well as to avoid potential drug interactions or magnesium toxicity.Hypermagnesemia is rare and results from failure to excrete magnesium or because of excessive intake. It may especially occur in patients with gastrointestinal or renal dysfunction, and have serious effects such as hypotension, bradycardia, depression of tendon reflexes, and other cardiovascular and neuromuscular manifestations .Other recent findings suggest that magnesium status and supplementation differentially affects vitamin D metabolism and may therefore affect 25(OH)D status . | Magnesium is a mineral that is important for normal bone structure in the body. People get magnesium from food, but sometimes supplements are needed. Magnesium is needed for many bodily functions. Low levels in the body have been linked to diseases such as osteoporosis, high blood pressure, and stroke. An easy way to remember foods that are good magnesium sources is to think of fiber. Foods that are high in fiber are generally high in magnesium. People commonly use magnesium for constipation, as an antacid for heartburn, for low magnesium levels, for pregnancy complications called pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, and for a certain type of irregular heartbeat (torsades de pointes). It's also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses.","When taken by mouth : Magnesium is likely safe for most people. Doses less than 350 mg daily are safe for most adults. In some people, magnesium might cause stomach upset, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other side effects. When taken in doses greater than 350 mg daily, magnesium is possibly unsafe. Large doses might cause too much magnesium to build up in the body, causing serious side effects including an irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure, confusion, slowed breathing, coma, and death. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Magnesium is likely safe for those pregnant or breast-feeding when taken by mouth in doses less than 350 mg daily. Magnesium is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in doses greater than 350 mg daily. High doses can cause diarrhea and too much magnesium in the blood. Children : Magnesium is likely safe when taken by mouth in daily doses of less than 65 mg for children 1-3 years, 110 mg for children 4-8 years, and 350 mg for children older than 8 years. Magnesium is likely unsafe when taken by mouth in higher doses. Alcohol use disorder : Alcohol abuse increases the risk for magnesium deficiency. Bleeding disorders : Magnesium seems to slow blood clotting. Taking magnesium might increase the risk of bleeding or bruising in people with bleeding disorders. Diabetes : Diabetes increases the risk for magnesium deficiency. Kidney conditions : Kidneys that don't work well have trouble clearing magnesium from the body. Taking extra magnesium can cause magnesium to build up to dangerous levels. Don't take magnesium if you have kidney problems.","Magnesium plays a significant role in vascular and metabolic biology as well as numerous biochemical reactions. It negatively regulates vascular calcification and osteogenic differentiation through an increase or restoration of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) activity and increased expression of anticalcification proteins, in vitro (45). It also influences blood pressure levels through interactions with the renin-angiotensin system, by acting as a calcium channel blocker to reduce vascular resistance, and by modulating vascular tone and reactivity (46) (47). Further, it contributes to the homeostasis of electrolytes in cells via sodium-potassium pump activation (47) and can revert impaired intracellular ion homeostasis (25).As a cofactor of all reactions involving ATP transfer, magnesium is a major determinant of insulin and glucose metabolism, critical to carbohydrate metabolism, and regulates the activity of all enzymes involved in phosphorylation reactions (48). These vascular and metabolic mechanisms are echoed by observed relationships between deficiency and oxidative stress, proinflammatory states, endothelial dysfunction, platelet aggregation, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia (48) (49). A possible mechanism of cardiovascular benefits may be via a reduction in arterial stiffness (76).Magnesium can also serve an immunomodulatory function by regulating NF-kB activation and cytokine production, and limiting systemic inflammation (50). It also reduces markers for systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction including C-reactive protein (4) (51). Its salts are poorly absorbed, and act as an osmotic laxative by retaining water in the intestine. The mechanism by which it may affect the bioavailability of concomitantly administered drugs is through the formation of insoluble chelate complexes with those drugs, substantially reducing their bioavailability (52).Experimental and epidemiological evidence for the role of magnesium in cancer is conflicting. Its part in cellular metabolism and maintaining genetic stability, regulation of cell proliferation, and protection against insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and systemic inflammation are also cancer-preventive attributes (18) (19). At the same time, hypomagnesemia as a side effect of some cancer treatments may produce an inhibitory effect on tumor growth and neo-angiogenesis, but magnesium levels are also increased in tumors both in vivo and in vitro, suggesting its multiple and possibly dichotomous roles in cancer (53) (54).","Magnesium oxide | Magnesium | Magnesium Creatine Chelate | Magnesium hydrogen phosphate trihydrate | Magnesium caprylate | Magnesium chloride hexahydrate | Magnesium carbonate | Leafy vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains, fruits and fish (4)","Comes in many forms including: | Magnesium glycinate | Magnesium oxide | Magnesium carbonate | Magnesium hydroxide (Milk of Magnesia) | Magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) | Aspartate de Magnésium, Atomic Number 12, Carbonate de Magnésium, Chélate de Magnésium, Chelated Magnesium, Chlorure de Magnésium, Citrate de Magnésium, Dimagnesium Malate,  Epsom Salts, Gluconate de Magnésium, Glycérophosphate de Magnésium, Glycinate de Magnésium, Hydroxyde de Magnésium, Lactate de Magnésium, Lait de Magnésium, Magnesia, Magnesia Carbonica, Magnesia Muriatica, Magnesia Phosphorica, Magnesia Sulfate, Magnesia Sulfurica, Magnesio, Magnesio Quelado, Magnésium, Magnesium Aspartate, Magnesium Carbonate, Magnesium Chelate, Magnésium Chelaté, Magnesium Chloride, Magnesium Citrate, Magnesium Disuccinate Hydrate, Magnesium Gluconate, Magnesium Glycerophosphate, Magnesium Glycinate, Magnesium Hydroxide, Magnesium Lactate, Magnesium Malate, Magnesium Murakab, Magnesium Orotate, Magnesium Oxide, Magnesium Phosphate, Magnesium Phosphoricum, Magnesium Sulfate, Magnesium Taurate, Magnesium Taurinate, Magnesium Trisilicate, Malate de Magnésium, Milk of Magnesia, Mg, Numéro Atomique 12, Orotate de Magnésium, Oxyde de Magnésium, Phosphate de Magnésium, Quelato de Magnesio, Sels d'Epsom, Sulfate de Magnésium, Trisilicate de Magnésium.",Magnesium | Magnesium metallicum | Magnesium creatine chelate | Magnesium phosphoricum | Magnesium octanoate | Magnesium chloratum | Magnesium glycyl glutamine | Magnesium carbonicum,Magnesium Silicate | Magnesium Creatine | Magnesium borate | Magnesium | Magnesium hydrogen sulfate | Magnesium Taurinate | Magnesium Octanoate,Magnesium,Magnesium

DSI000171,"(3R,3'R,6'R)-beta,epsilon-Carotene-3,3'-diol",C0043328,"Lutein is a natural carotenoid pigment synthesized by plants and microorganisms. Carotenoids are classified as either provitamin A (alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin, which can be converted into retinol) or nonprovitamin A (lutein, lycopene, and zeaxanthin). Lutein has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, and supplements are marketed as protection against ocular diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and for general eye health. Preliminary studies on lutein supplementation in various populations suggest it may reduce biomarkers for coronary vascular disease, increase serum and plasma lutein, and reduce inflammatory cytokines . In addition, lutein supplementation may improve visual field in patients with retinitis pigmentosa and retinal function in patients with early AMD . A recent meta-analysis also suggests benefit with lutein supplementation for AMD , although older studies found insufficient evidence , and data on whether it improves macular pigment optical density are mixed . Other long-term studies found no effects with supplementation on cognitive function or risk for cataract surgery or vision loss . Dietary lutein may protect against DNA damage, but this may be due to concomitant intake of other micronutrients . Epidemiologic studies also suggest an association between increased lutein consumption and decreased incidence of atherosclerosis and cataracts , although the effects of dietary lutein on macular degeneration are inconsistent . With respect to effects on cancer risk, increased lutein consumption was associated with decreased risks for some types of kidney, bladder, and breast cancers , but not lung or prostate cancers , and effects on risk of cervical or colon cancer are conflicting . | Lutein is a type of organic pigment called a carotenoid. It is related to beta-carotene and vitamin A. Many people think of lutein as ""the eye vitamin."" Lutein is one of two major carotenoids found in the human eye (macula and retina). It is thought to function as a light filter, protecting the eye tissues from sunlight damage. Foods rich in lutein include egg yolks, spinach, kale, corn, orange pepper, kiwi fruit, grapes, zucchini, and squash. Lutein is commonly taken by mouth to prevent eye diseases, including cataracts and a disease that leads to vision loss in older adults (age-related macular degeneration or AMD). Lutein is used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these other uses.","When taken by mouth : Lutein is likely safe when taken by mouth. Consuming up to 20 mg of lutein daily as part of the diet or as a supplement appears to be safe. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Lutein is likely safe when used in the amounts found in food. Children : Lutein is likely safe when taken by mouth in appropriate amounts. A specific product (LUTEINofta, SOOFT Italia SpA) containing lutein 0.14 mg daily has been safely used in infants for 36 weeks.","Lutein is one of the predominant carotenoids that accumulates in both the lens and retinal macula (24). It scavenges reactive oxygen species, preventing damage to DNA and protein molecules (19) (25). As an oxycarotenoid, its structure is less hydrophobic than beta-carotene and lycopene. This enables lutein to react with free radicals in a membrane’s aqueous phase, resulting in increased membrane integrity, which may in turn affect tissue permeability to oxygen and other molecules (19). It may also protect against ocular damage by reducing the amount of blue light that reaches photoreceptors (25).
As a nonprovitamin A carotenoid, lutein does not have any vitamin A activity, but does have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immune-enhancing properties. In an obese rat model, lutein independently reduced superoxide dismutase activity, and also raised glutathione peroxidase activity in lean rats when combined with ascorbic acid (26). In vitro and atherosclerotic mouse models demonstrate the ability of lutein to inhibit monocyte inflammatory responses to low-density lipoprotein in the artery wall and reduce monocyte migration (7). In humans, lutein supplementation decreases lipid peroxidation and inflammatory response (5).
Carotenoids including lutein inhibit mutagenesis and transformation, and premalignant lesions (1). In murine mammary cancer models, dietary lutein selectively modulated apoptosis and inhibited angiogenesis by increasing p53 and Bax proapoptotic gene expression, while decreasing Bcl-2 antiapoptotic gene expression with a subsequent increase in Bax:Bcl-2 ratio in tumors (27). Lutein-mediated AP-1 suppression and anti-inflammatory effects are due to its antioxidative and p38/c-Jun-N-terminal kinase inhibitory activities (3).

DSI000172,Beta-carotene,C0053396,"A natural pigment synthesized by plants, beta-carotene is used as an antioxidant, as an immunostimulant, and to prevent or treat cancer, AIDS, heart disease, and leukoplakia. Beta-carotene, along with alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin, can be converted to retinol and is classified as a provitamin A carotenoid. Supplementation with beta-carotene does not increase overall vitamin A levels or lead to vitamin A toxicity. Available data of beta-carotene supplementation for HIV-positive patients and its effects on CD4 counts as well as cardiovascular disease are conflicting. A meta-analysis demonstrated a small but significant increase in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death for the beta-carotene arm over placebo , whereas other studies reported no such effects nor any benefits of beta-carotene supplementation against cardiovascular disease , or its risk factors . However, higher intake of fruits and vegetables, but not antioxidant supplements, reduced intra-abdominal visceral fat and was associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, total cancer, and all-cause mortality . Supplementation (with or without vitamin A) may actually increase the risk of cardiovascular mortality . Beta-carotene has also been inversely correlated with metabolic syndrome . Another meta-analysis did not find any correlation between beta-carotene supplementation and hematologic malignancies . Consistent associations between serum beta-carotene levels and risk of developing type 2 diabetes are lacking as well . Additional studies have reported beta-carotene to protect adults under 40 years from seasonal influenza virus when used with Levilactobacillus brevis KB290 ; serum beta-carotene to be inversely associated with the incidence of cataract formation ; higher intake of β-carotene (while avoiding vitamin C supplements) to be associated with lowered risk of acquired hearing loss in women ; high dietary intake to have a protective effect on buccal cells from relative telomere length (RTL) shortening . Data on the effects of supplementation for preventing cognitive decline are conflicting . Epidemiological associations between beta-carotene and cancer risk are conflicting. Whereas high dietary intake was associated with reduced risk of cervical cancer ; and limited evidence suggesting an inverse association with overall survival in breast cancer patients , high serum levels were correlated with increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer , but with reduced risk of aggressive urothelial cell carcinoma . Findings of beta-carotene and chemoprevention are inconsistent as well. Consumption of beta carotene, vitamins A, C, fruits and vegetables did not influence the risk of renal cell carcinoma ; supplementation with antioxidants, beta-carotene and vitamins A, C, and E, did not prevent gastrointestinal cancer, and beta-carotene may actually increase risk of lung cancer and overall mortality . Data from large, multi-center trials suggest that supplementation may not lower the risk of prostate cancer ; and in male smokers over the age 40, it may increase lung cancer incidence , regardless of the tar or nicotine content of cigarettes smoked . When combined with cigarette smoking, beta-carotene supplements may also reduce the efficacy of cancer therapies, resulting in increased recurrence and mortality . Additional data from a large-scale cohort study suggest that alcohol consumption, too, has a negative effect on the chemopreventive property of beta-carotene . Furthermore, long-term supplementation may not have a meaningful effect on total or cancer mortality more than a decade after supplementation ends . The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against beta-carotene or vitamin E supplements for the prevention of cardiovascular disease or cancer . | Beta-carotene belongs to a group of colored pigments called carotenoids. It's converted to vitamin A in the body and found in many fruits and vegetables. Beta-carotene and other red, orange, and yellow pigments called carotenoids are considered antioxidants. They provide about 50% of the vitamin A needed in the diet. Vitamin A is an essential nutrient. Its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects help to protect cells from damage. People use beta-carotene for an inherited disorder marked by sensitivity to light. It is also used to prevent certain cancers, heart disease, cataracts, aging skin, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. Many global health authorities recommend getting beta-carotene and other antioxidants from food instead of supplements.","When taken by mouth : Beta-carotene is likely safe when taken in appropriate amounts for certain medical conditions. But beta-carotene supplements are not recommended for general use. Beta-carotene supplements are possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in high doses, especially when taken long-term. High doses of beta-carotene can turn skin yellow or orange. Taking high doses of beta-carotene supplements might also increase the chance of death from all causes, increase the risk of certain cancers, and possibly cause other serious side effects. Beta-carotene from food does not seem to have these effects. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Beta-carotene is likely safe when taken by mouth in appropriate amounts. But there isn't enough reliable information to know if high doses of beta-carotene are safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Beta-carotene is likely safe when taken by mouth in appropriate amounts. History of asbestos exposure : In people who have been exposed to asbestos, beta-carotene supplements might increase the risk of cancer. Don't take beta-carotene supplements if you have been exposed to asbestos. Smoking : In people who smoke, beta-carotene supplements might increase the risk of colon, lung, and prostate cancer. Don't take beta-carotene supplements if you smoke.","Beta-carotene has strong antioxidant effects, and protects lipid peroxidation and provitamin-A activity, thereby preventing oxidative damage (34). It was also shown to alleviate the severity of ulcerative colitis in a murine model by modulating several molecular targets including nuclear factor-kappa B, cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin 17, and connective tissue growth factor (35).
In other studies, beta-carotene reduced cell growth and induced apoptosis in a variety of cancer cell lines through caveolin-1 expression (20). It also induces glutathione production (21); enhances macrophage function and natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity; and increases T-helper lymphocyte counts. However, clinical findings suggest that beta-carotene can increase cancer risk. It was shown to induce angiogenic gene expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) as well as HUVEC migration (22); and stimulate cellular proliferation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (23) as well as in lung cancer cells (24).

Iodine reduces thyroid hormone and can kill fungus, bacteria, and other microorganisms such as amoebas. Iodine deficiency is one of the most common and preventable world health problems. Most iodine is found in the ocean, where it is concentrated by sea life, particularly in seaweed. Iodine is taken by mouth to prevent and treat iodine deficiency and its consequences, including goiter and some thyroid disorders. A specific kind of iodine called potassium iodide is also US FDA approved to prevent thyroid damage after a radioactive accident. Iodine is also used for pink eye, gum infections, wound healing, and many other conditions, but there is limited scientific evidence to support many of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Iodine is likely safe for most people when taken in doses less than 1100 mcg daily. Large amounts or long-term use of iodine is possibly unsafe. Adults should avoid prolonged use of higher doses without proper medical supervision. Higher intake can increase the risk of side effects such as thyroid problems. Iodine in larger amounts can cause metallic taste, soreness of teeth and gums, burning in mouth and throat, stomach upset, and many other side effects. When applied to the skin : Iodine is likely safe for most people when appropriately diluted products are used. A 2% iodine solution is an FDA-approved prescription product. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Iodine is likely safe when taken by mouth in recommended amounts or when applied to the skin appropriately using an approved product (2% solution). Do not take more than 1100 mcg of iodine daily if you are over 18 years old; do not take more than 900 mcg of iodine daily if you are 14-18 years old.

Iron helps red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to cells all over the body. Iron also plays a role in many important functions in the body. People commonly use iron for preventing and treating different types of anemia caused by low iron levels. It is also used for heart failure, memory and thinking skills, child development, fatigue, ADHD, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses.","When taken by mouth : Iron is likely safe for most people when used in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 45 mg elemental iron daily. It can cause side effects such as stomach upset, nausea, and vomiting. Taking iron supplements with food seems to reduce side effects. But food can also reduce how well the body absorbs iron. Doses above the UL should only be used while under medical supervision. Iron is likely unsafe when taken in excessive doses. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Iron is likely safe to use while pregnant and breast-feeding in doses below the UL of 45 mg of elemental iron by mouth daily. But iron is likely unsafe when taken by mouth in high doses. If you do not have iron deficiency, don't take more than 45 mg daily. Higher doses can cause stomach side effects such as nausea and vomiting and may even increase the risk for preterm birth. Children : Iron is likely safe when taken by mouth in doses below the UL of 40 mg of elemental iron daily. But high doses of iron are likely unsafe for children. Iron is the most common cause of poisoning deaths in children. Doses as low as 60 mg/kg can be fatal. Diabetes : High iron intake in the diet might increase the risk of heart disease in females with type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, discuss your iron intake with your healthcare provider.

A meta-analysis showed that vitamin E increases the risk for hemorrhagic stroke but reduces the risk of ischemic stroke . Vitamin E may reduce symptoms of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in adults , but not in children and adolescents .Vitamin E may have a preventive effect on bone loss in postmenopausal osteopenic women and improve male infertility .Limited studies on Vitamin E to improve symptoms in cancer patients suggest it may help relieve hot flashes in breast cancer survivors and prevent symptoms of CIPN , reduce incidence of cisplatin-induced neurotoxicity , and prevent radiodermatitis in breast cancer patients .Data on whether Vitamin E supplementation can reduce cancer risk are mixed , and some studies even suggest it may increase cancer risk . In prostate cancer, data from the SELECT trial showed that vitamin E alone or with selenium for 5 years did not reduce prostate cancer risk , and significantly increased risk at 7 years’ follow-up . Vitamin E taken with soy and selenium also did not prevent prostate cancer progression . Some studies suggest an association between dietary tocopherol and reduced risks for lung and liver cancers. In addition, a meta-analysis supports dietary intake of various nutrients including alpha-tocopherol, but not antioxidant supplement use, for chronic disease prevention .Toxicity may occur with chronic supplementation of vitamin E in doses greater than 800 IU. Daily supplementation over 400 IU may increase all-cause mortality . Vitamin E may also enhance the activity of warfarin. In a large study of patients treated with warfarin, higher serum vitamin E levels predicted hemorrhagic events . | Vitamin E is a vitamin that dissolves in fat. It is found in many foods including vegetable oils, cereals, meat, poultry, eggs, and fruits. Vitamin E is an important vitamin required for the proper function of many organs in the body. It is also an antioxidant. Vitamin E that occurs naturally in foods (RRR-alpha-tocopherol) is different from man-made vitamin E that is in supplements (all-rac-alpha-tocopherol). Vitamin E is used for treating vitamin E deficiency, which is rare, but can occur in people with certain genetic disorders and in very low-weight premature infants. Vitamin E is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses.","When taken by mouth : Vitamin E is likely safe for most people when taken in doses lower than 1000 mg daily. This is the same as 1100 IU of synthetic vitamin E (all-rac-alpha-tocopherol) or 1500 IU of natural vitamin E (RRR-alpha-tocopherol). The risk of side effects increases with higher doses. Side effects can include nausea, fatigue, headache, and bleeding. Vitamin E is possibly unsafe when taken in doses greater than 1000 mg daily. When applied to the skin : Vitamin E is likely safe for most people. When inhaled : Vitamin E is possibly unsafe. Use of e-cigarettes and other vaping products containing vitamin E acetate has been linked to serious lung injury in some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : When used in the recommended daily amount, vitamin E is possibly safe during pregnancy. Do not take vitamin E supplements during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy without speaking with your healthcare provider. It might be harmful to the baby. Later in pregnancy, the maximum recommended amount of vitamin E is 800 mg in those 14-18 years of age and 1000 mg in those older than 18 years of age. Breast-feeding : Vitamin E is likely safe when taken by mouth in recommended daily amounts. The maximum recommended amount of vitamin E while breast-feeding is 800 mg in those 14-18 years of age and 1000 mg in those older than 18 years of age. Vitamin E is possibly unsafe when taken in doses greater than the maximum recommended amount. Children : Vitamin E is likely safe when taken by mouth appropriately. But children should avoid taking doses of vitamin E higher than the daily upper limits. These limits are 300 IU in children 1-3 years of age, 450 IU in children 4-8 years of age, 900 IU in children 9-13 years of age, and 1200 IU in children 14-18 years of age. Bleeding disorders : Vitamin E might make bleeding disorders worse. If you have a bleeding disorder, avoid taking vitamin E supplements. Heart disease : Vitamin E might increase the risk for death in people with a history of heart disease. People with a history of heart disease should avoid taking doses of vitamin E greater than 400 IU daily. Diabetes : Vitamin E might increase the risk for heart failure in people with diabetes. People with diabetes should avoid taking doses of vitamin E greater than 400 IU daily. Head and neck cancer : Vitamin E might increase the chance that this cancer will return. Do not take vitamin E supplements in doses greater than 400 IU daily. Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis) : Exercise is sometimes used by people with osteoporosis to improve bone strength. Exercising and taking high doses of vitamin E and vitamin C might lessen the benefits of exercise on bone strength. Prostate cancer : Vitamin E might increase the chance of developing prostate cancer. The effect of vitamin E in people who currently have prostate cancer isn't clear, but it might worsen the condition. An inherited eye condition that causes poor night vision and loss of side vision (retinitis pigmentosa) : All-rac-alpha-tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E) 400 IU seems to speed vision loss in people with this condition. But much lower amounts (3 IU) don't seem to have this effect. If you have this condition, it is best to avoid vitamin E supplements. Stroke : Vitamin E might increase the risk for death in some people with a history of stroke. People with a history of stroke should avoid taking doses of vitamin E greater than 400 IU daily. Surgery : Vitamin E might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using vitamin E supplements at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that acts as an antioxidant. The natural form of vitamin E is composed of 4 different tocopherols and 4 different tocotrienol homologues (alpha, beta, delta, and gamma). All 8 forms have antioxidant activity, but recent data indicate the different homologues have different activities unrelated to antioxidant effects (34).Gamma-tocopherol is a stronger inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and traps reactive oxygen species more effectively than alpha-tocopherol. In vitro and in vivo, gamma-tocopherol exhibits antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects whereas alpha-tocopherol does not (34). While both alpha- and gamma-tocopherols exhibit anti-inflammatory effects in vitro and in vivo, gamma-enriched mixed tocopherols may have more activity than alpha-tocopherols. This may help explain the negative outcomes of recent large-scale intervention studies that used only the alpha homologue (34).The d-alpha-tocopherol isomer is believed to be the active principle. Natural vitamin E supplements contain d-alpha-tocopherol derived from plant oil sources, whereas synthetic supplements are composed of a racemic mixture of d- and l-alpha-tocopherols. The major function of d-alpha-tocopherol is to prevent the propagation of free radical reactions by acting as a peroxyl radical scavenger and protecting polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in membrane phospholipids and plasma lipoproteins. Alpha-tocopherol reportedly causes inhibition of protein kinase C activity, which is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation in smooth muscle cells, human platelets, and monocytes. Vitamin E enrichment of endothelial cells downregulates expression of intercellular and vascular cell adhesion molecules to decrease adhesion of blood cell components to the endothelium. Vitamin E also upregulates expression of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and cyclooxegenase-1, which leads to release of prostacyclin, a vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation in humans (3).In an animal study, vitamin E increased lung cancer cell proliferation due to its antioxidant activity by reducing reactive oxygen species, DNA damage, and p53 expression (47).","dl-alpha Tocopheryl acetate | Glycine max - Seed | Plant-derived oils (wheat germ, soybean, sunflower, almond, safflower, corn), wheat germ, liver, eggs, nuts and seeds, green leafy vegetables, whole grains (1) (2)","Tocopherol | Alpha-tocopherol | dl-tocopherol | Tocotrienol | RRR-alpha-tocopherol | Acétate d'Alpha Tocophérol, Acétate d'Alpha Tocophéryl, Acétate de D-Alpha-Tocophéryl, Acétate de DL-Alpha-Tocophéryl, Acétate de Tocophérol, Acétate de Tocophéryl, Acétate de Vitamine E, All Rac-Alpha-Tocopherol, All-Rac-Alpha-Tocophérol, Alpha-Tocophérol, Alpha Tocopherol Acetate, Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, Alpha-Tocopherol, Alpha-Tocophérol, Alpha tocopherol, Beta-tocopherol, Bêta-tocophérol, Beta tocopherol, D-Alpha Tocopherol, D-Alpha Tocophérol, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Succinate, D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate, D-Alpha-Tocopherol, D-Alpha-Tocophérol, D-Alpha-Tocopheryl Acetate, D-Alpha-Tocopheryl Acid Succinate, D-Alpha-Tocopheryl Succinate, D-Alpha-Tocopheryl, D-Alpha-Tocophéryl, D-Beta-Tocopherol, D-Bêta-Tocophérol, D-Delta-Tocopherol, D-Delta-Tocophérol, Delta Tocopherol, Delta-Tocopherol, Delta-tocophérol, D-Gamma-Tocopherol, D-Gamma-Tocophérol, DL-Alpha-Tocopherol, DL-Alpha-Tocophérol, DL-Alpha-Tocopheryl Acetate, DL-Alpha-Tocopheryl, DL-Alpha-Tocophéryl, DL-Tocopherol, DL-Tocophérol, D-Tocopherol, D-Tocophérol, D-Tocopheryl Acetate, Fat-Soluble Vitamin, Gamma-Tocopherol, Gamma-Tocophérol, Gamma tocopherol, Mixed Tocopherols, RRR-Alpha-Tocopherol, RRR-Alpha-Tocophérol, Succinate Acide de D-Alpha-Tocophéryl, Succinate Acide de Tocophéryl, Succinate de D-Alpha-Tocophéryl, Succinate de Tocophéryl, Succinate de Vitamine E, Tocopherol Acetate, Tocopherol, Tocophérol, Tocophérols Mixtes, Tocopheryl Acetate, Tocopheryl Acid Succinate, Tocopheryl Succinate, Vitamin E Acetate, Vitamin E Succinate, Vitamina E, Vitamine E, Vitamine Liposoluble, Vitamine Soluble dans les Graisses.",Vitamin E | Mixed tocopherol concentrate,Vitamin E (unspecified) | Vitamin E (Alpha-Tocomonoenol) | Vitamin E | Vitamin E (mixed) | Vitamin E (beta-tocopherol) | Vitamin E (tocopherol not specified) | Vitamin E (not specified) | Vitamin E (gamma unspecified),Vitamin E,Vitamin E

DSI000192,N-acetyl-L-cysteine,C0001047,"N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is an antioxidant that is used as a prescription drug and as a dietary supplement. As a drug, it is given parenterally or orally to treat acetaminophen overdose. It also has other clinical applications. For example, the inhalant and oral solution forms have a mucolytic effect, and are used to relieve obstructions in bronchial diseases and in tracheotomy procedures. The oral capsule is marketed as a dietary supplement for its liver-protective properties and to support healthy immune functioning. Clinical studies show that NAC can treat drug-induced hepatotoxicity . For prevention of contrast-induced acute kidney injury, a meta-analysis found misleading beneficial associations that were lost when analysis was restricted to larger studies , and mechanistic studies showed that oral NAC is poorly absorbed with no renoprotective effects . Results with NAC for chronic lung disease are mixed. Some studies suggest it can reduce exacerbations , inflammation , and help improve or maintain lung function , but such benefits were not observed in other trials . In addition, a meta-analysis suggests it is not the most effective mucolytic agent for COPD . There has also been interest in using NAC to improve psychiatric conditions, but studies are mixed on whether it can help conditions such as compulsive disorders or depression . Although small studies suggest that NAC may inhibit cancer biomarker development , a large trial found it did not inhibit formation of secondary head and neck or lung tumors . Other preliminary findings suggest NAC may help reduce cancer treatment-related side effects such as liver toxicity , neuropathy , mucositis , or poor hematopoietic function , but it did not reduce oxidative stress or cisplatin toxicities . It is also unclear whether NAC, as an antioxidant, may alter cancer treatment effectiveness. Gastrointestinal side effects have been reported and unpleasant product odor that required masking has been noted . Although it is generally known for its safety profile, NAC supplementation in an animal model appeared to accelerate lung cancer growth . Therefore additional studies are needed to determine safety, feasibility, and efficacy. | N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) comes from the amino acid L-cysteine. Amino acids are building blocks of proteins. NAC has many uses and is an FDA approved drug. N-acetyl cysteine is an antioxidant that might play a role in preventing cancer. As a drug, it's used by healthcare providers to treat acetaminophen (Tylenol) poisoning. It works by binding the poisonous forms of acetaminophen that are formed in the liver. People commonly use N-acetyl cysteine for cough and other lung conditions. It is also used for flu, dry eye, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using N-acetyl cysteine for COVID-19. Although many dietary supplement products contain N-acetyl cysteine, the US FDA has stated that it's illegal for dietary supplements to contain N-acetyl cysteine since it's technically an approved drug. But as of August 2022, the FDA is considering changing this stance. It may allow for N-acetyl cysteine in dietary supplements as long as no safety issues come up. A final decision is pending. Prescription N-acetyl cysteine products are available under the guidance of a healthcare provider.","When taken by mouth : N-acetyl cysteine is likely safe for most adults. N-acetyl cysteine is an FDA-approved prescription drug. It can cause side effects such as dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. It has an unpleasant odor that some people find hard to tolerate. When inhaled : N-acetyl cysteine is likely safe for most adults, when used as a prescription medication. It can cause swelling in the mouth, runny nose, drowsiness, clamminess, and chest tightness. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : N-acetyl cysteine is possibly safe when taken by mouth or inhaled during pregnancy. N-acetyl cysteine crosses the placenta, but there is no evidence that it harms the unborn child. But N-acetyl cysteine should only be used when medically needed. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if N-acetyl cysteine is safe to use during breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : N-acetyl cysteine is likely safe when taken by mouth in doses of 900-2700 mg daily for up to 12 weeks. Allergy : Don't use N-acetyl cysteine if you are allergic to acetyl cysteine. Asthma : N-acetyl cysteine might cause bronchospasm in people with asthma if inhaled or taken by mouth. If you take N-acetyl cysteine and have asthma, you should be monitored by your healthcare provider. Bleeding disorder . N-acetyl cysteine might slow blood clotting. N-acetyl cysteine might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding in people with bleeding disorders. Surgery . N-acetyl cysteine might slow blood clotting. This might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop taking N-acetyl cysteine at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","NAC is a precursor to glutathione (GSH). It is used as both an antidote for acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity, and as a mucolytic agent for respiratory diseases. NAC reduces disulphide bonds to sulfhydryl bonds to reduce mucus formation (20). Its hepatoprotective action may occur by cytokine-mediated mechanisms as well as GSH replenishment (21). NAC crosses the blood-brain barrier, increases brain GSH levels, and acts as a glutamine modulator (11).
In vitro, NAC improved ifosfamide benefits by decreasing nephrotoxicity without reducing antitumor effects (26). NAC altered doxorubicin-induced NF-κB activity via concentration-dependent anti- and pro-oxidant mechanisms (27). This biphasic effect was also time-dependent (28). In androgen-independent human prostate cancer PC-3 cells, antiproliferative effects were attributed to upregulated Cyr61 protein expression (28).
Other mechanistic studies show that oral NAC is poorly absorbed with no renoprotective effects (53). In an animal model, NAC increased lung cancer cell proliferation due to its antioxidant activity by reducing ROS, DNA damage, and p53 expression (36).",N-Acetyl-L-cysteine | N-Acetyl-L-cysteine | N-acetyl cysteine | N-acetyl cysteine,"Acetylcysteine | NAC | N-acetyl-cysteine | Acetyl Cysteine, Acétyl Cystéine, Acetylcysteine, Acétylcystéine, NAC, N-Acetil Cisteína, N-Acetyl-B-Cysteine, N-Acétyl Cystéine, N-Acetyl-L-Cysteine, N-Acétyl-L-Cystéine, N-Acetylcysteine, N-Acétylcystéine.",N-acetyl-L-cysteine | N-Acetyl-L-cysteine | N-Acetyl Cysteine | N-acetylcysteine | N-acetyl cysteine,N-Acetyl Cysteine | N-acetylcysteine,N-Acetylcysteine,N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC)

It is widely used in herbal therapy and promoted as a dietary supplement to help improve eyesight and promote overall eye health. The anthocyanins in bilberry are thought to regenerate rhodopsin, a pigment present in retinal photoreceptor cells. Preclinical studies suggest bilberry polyphenols protect against neurodegenerative processes and eye disorders , as well as help visual functioning and protect against retinal diseases . Small studies indicate that bilberry fruit improves visual function in individuals with normal tension glaucoma and relieves tonic accommodation of the ciliary muscle caused by visual display terminal and near-vision tasks , but others produced mixed data with a systematic review citing the need for well-designed trials . Additional studies found a standardized bilberry extract reduced disease activity in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis and a bilberry formulation was effective against hemorrhoidal disease . Dietary bilberry also altered lipid profiles and improved glucose metabolism in individuals at high risk for type 2 diabetes and produced beneficial changes in serum lipids and lipoproteins in women with higher metabolic risk, but had an unexpected opposite effect in women at low risk . Bilberry fruit may decrease biomarkers of inflammation indicative of reduced cardiometabolic risk in the long term , but whether it lowers the risk of cardiovascular disease is not clear . Bilberry consumption resulted in small to moderate increases in exercise-induced delayed onset muscle soreness and C-reactive Protein . Bilberry showed anticancer effects in preclinical models and protected against chemo-induced oral mucositis . Preliminary findings suggest bilberry extract reduces proliferation of colorectal cancer cells and a proprietary mixed herbal extract relieves chemo/radiotherapy-induced mucositis in pediatric and adult cancer patients . However, the extent to which bilberry itself was responsible for such effects is unclear. | Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) is a plant that produces berries similar to the American blueberry. The dried fruit and leaves are used as medicine. Bilberry contains chemicals called tannins. They might help reduce swelling. The chemicals in bilberry leaves might also help to lower blood sugar and cholesterol levels, and improve circulation in people with diabetes. People use bilberry for night vision, poor circulation that can cause the legs to swell, high blood pressure, and many other conditions. But there is no good scientific evidence to support any of these uses. | Bog bilberry (Vaccinium uliginosum) is a plant. The dried or ripe fruit is eaten as food and is sometimes used to make medicine. Bog bilberry fruit contains chemicals that might help reduce swelling. People use bog bilberry for eye strain, diarrhea, bladder problems, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Do not to confuse bog bilberry with bilberry or blueberry. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : Eating dried, ripe bilberry fruit in typical food amounts is likely safe for most people. Bilberry fruit extracts are possibly safe when taken in doses up to 160 mg daily for up to 6 months. But bilberry leaf is possibly unsafe to take in high doses or for a long time. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Bilberry fruit is likely safe when consumed in small amounts as a food. There isn't enough reliable information to know if it is safe to use bilberry in the higher doses found in medicine when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick with food amounts. Surgery : Bilberry might affect blood sugar levels. This could interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop taking bilberry at least two weeks before a scheduled surgery. | When taken by mouth : The fresh fruit of bog bilberry is possibly safe when eaten as food. There isn't enough reliable information to know if bog bilberry fruit is safe to use in larger amounts as medicine. But it is likely unsafe to eat large amounts of fresh bog bilberry fruit that is contaminated with fungus. The fungus that sometimes grows on bog bilberry fruit can be poisonous in large amounts. Signs of poisoning include vomiting, mental changes, weakness, changes in vision, and other symptoms. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Bog bilberry fruit is possibly safe when eaten as a food. But it is likely unsafe to consume bog bilberry fruits that are contaminated with fungus. There isn't enough reliable information to know if non-contaminated fruits are safe to use in larger amounts as medicine when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts.","In vitro, bilberry polyphenols inhibited amyloid fibril formation and dissolved preformed toxic aggregates and mature fibrils, suggesting a role in controlling fibril formations of various proteins that occur with neurodegenerative diseases (1). Bilberry anthocyanins modulated oxidative stress defense enzymes heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutathione S-transferase-pi (GST-pi) in human retinal pigment epithelial cells (2). In vitro and in vivo, bilberry inhibited angiogenesis through inhibition of ERK 1/2 and Akt phosphorylation (4). In an animal model of uveitis and retinal inflammation, pretreatment with a bilberry extract prevented photoreceptor impairment, relieved intracellular ROS elevation, activated retinal NF-ĸB in the inflamed retina, and suppressed the decrease of rhodopsin via inhibition of IL-6, which activates STAT3, thereby protecting outer segment length in photoreceptor cells (3). In a monocytic cell line, quercetin, epicatechin, and resveratrol inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF-kappaB activation (14).
In individuals with hypercholesterolemia, anthocyanins may improve endothelium-dependent vasodilation by activating the NO-cGMP signaling pathway (28). The polyphenols in bilberry juice can modulate inflammation by decreasing plasma C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, -15, and monokine induced by INFγ (MIG) (14).
In human colon and liver cancer cell lines, bilberry anthocyanins demonstrated intracellular antioxidant activity even though concentrations applied were very low (29). Bilberry extract inhibited human leukemia, colon, and breast cancer cells through apoptotic induction and/or inhibition of cell proliferation (17) (30).

It often is used in combination with other botanicals such as PC-SPES and sho-saiko-to. Preclinical data suggest that compounds in S. baicalensis cause apoptosis in various cancer cells or protect against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity . However, both S. baicalensis root and its main flavonoid baicalin appear to have dose-dependent pro- and anti-angiogenic effects . Some constituents may also have neuroprotective , anticonvulsant , and anti-inflammatory effects. Studies in humans are quite limited. A preliminary study of S. baicalensis along with metformin appeared to improved glucose tolerance, inflammation, and gut microbiota in patients with type 2 diabetes . An herbal supplement containing S. baicalensis reduced symptoms of osteoarthritis . However, it is not known if the herb would exert similar effects by itself, and cases of hepatotoxicity with some supplements have been reported . | Baikal skullcap (Scutellaria baicalensis) is a plant native to China and Korea. The root has been used in Chinese medicine for psychiatric disorders. Baikal skullcap contains chemicals that might decrease swelling and stop tumor growth. Baikal skullcap is used for respiratory infections, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any uses. There is also no good evidence to support using Baikal skullcap for COVID-19. Don't confuse Baikal skullcap with skullcap. They are different plants.","When taken by mouth : Baikal skullcap is possibly safe for most adults when taken for up to 8 weeks. It might cause stomach pain, constipation, vomiting, and stomach upset. One specific product (Limbrel, Primus Pharmaceuticals) has been linked to serious side effects. It contains a mixture of Baikal skullcap and catechu. There have been multiple reports of liver and lung injury with this product. In 2017, the US FDA recalled this product due to serious safety concerns. It's unclear if these concerns are due to Baikal skullcap, catechu, or the combination. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if Baikal skullcap is safe or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if Baikal skullcap is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Bleeding disorders . Baikal skullcap might slow blood clotting. In theory, Baikal skullcap might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding in people with bleeding disorders. Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Baikal skullcap might have the same effects as estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by estrogen, don't use Baikal skullcap. Surgery : Baikal skullcap might slow blood clotting. It might cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using Baikal skullcap at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","In vitro, the flavonoid baicalin exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and gram-positive antibacterial activity (3). In animal models, attenuation of asthma was attributed to reduced airway injury and restored mitochondrial function (19). Neuroprotective effects of flavonoids were ameliorated by diazepam, a GABA receptor agonist, suggesting that the components influence GABA receptor activity (5).
Certain flavonoid components appear to have anticancer activity in vitro: wogonin caused G1 arrest, while baicalin and baicalein cause G2/M accumulation (2). Baicalin also activated caspase-3, resulting in apoptosis of leukemia-derived T cells. However, low doses of baicalin upregulated expression of multiple angiogenic genes to increase cell proliferation in developing blood vessels, while high doses inhibited angiogenesis by inducing cell death, suggesting dose-dependent dual effects.

DSI000205,L-Theanine,C0076380,"L-theanine is a water soluble amino acid found in green tea and mushrooms. Purified L-theanine is available as an oral dietary supplement, and is used for its perceived antioxidant and relaxant effects . Preclinical studies suggest neuroprotective and enhanced chemotherapeutic effects as well as reduced chemotoxicity , but L-theanine may also alter neurotransmitter levels . Data in humans are limited. Small studies suggest improvements in sleep , but effects on anxiety are mixed . Epidemiological data suggest green tea consumption may contribute to stroke prevention , but it is unclear whether L-theanine alone may confer this benefit. Other preliminary data suggest oral theanine along with cystine may reduce neuropathy in patients receiving oxaliplatin . Patients undergoing chemotherapy should discuss the use of L-theanine with their physicians because most purported effects are not based on clinical trials, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in green tea reduces activity of the chemotherapy drug bortezomib. | Theanine is an amino acid found in tea and some mushrooms. It comes in two forms: L-theanine and D-theanine. L-theanine is the most common form. Theanine is similar to glutamate, a naturally occurring amino acid. Glutamate helps transmit nerve impulses in the brain. Theanine sometimes acts like glutamate in the body. But other times it seems to block the effects of glutamate. Theanine might also affect the brain chemicals GABA, dopamine, and serotonin. People use L-theanine to improve mental function. It is also used for anxiety, mental impairment, stress, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse theanine with another amino acid called threonine. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : L-theanine is possibly safe when used short-term. Doses of up to 900 mg daily have been safely used for 8 weeks. It isn't clear if L-theanine is safe to use for longer periods of time. It might cause mild side effects, such as headache or sleepiness. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if theanine is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : L-theanine is possibly safe when taken by mouth, short-term. Doses of 400 mg daily have been safely used for up to 6 weeks in males aged 8-12 years.","As a non-protein amino acid, L-theanine crosses the blood-brain barrier, exerting various neurophysiological and pharmacological effects including: anxiolytic and calming effects, due to inhibitory neurotransmitters and selective serotonin and dopamine modulation; cognitive improvements perhaps through decreased NMDA-dependent CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) and increased NMDA-independent CA1-LTP; and improved selective attention during mental tasks likely due to changes in alpha brain wave activity (25). Neuroprotective effects are also thought to be due to its selective binding to glutamate receptors (2).
In animal models, L-theanine appears to have a dose-dependent biphasic effect on NSAID-induced gastric ulcers, delaying healing at higher doses (40 mg/kg), but accelerating healing at lower doses (10 mg/kg) perhaps through the maintenance of glutathione levels thus protecting against oxidative damage (26).
In human studies, L-theanine attenuated effects of caffeine on oxygenated hemoglobin, cognition, and mood, suggesting both independent and interactive effects between the two compounds (22). Other studies suggest that combining caffeine and theanine intake causes their individual effects to counteract each other (30) (31). L-theanine also stabilizes glutamatergic concentrations in the brain, which may explain its therapeutic effect in patients with schizophrenia (21).
L-theanine was shown to increase the antitumor activity of chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin and idarubicin (5) (6). These agents normally bind the glutamate receptor and the complex is transported across the cell resulting in reduced concentrations, hence attenuating effects of these drugs. Consequent mechanistic studies revealed that L-theanine, a glutamate analogue, competes with glutamate to bind the glutamate receptor, resulting in suppression of chemotherapy efflux (extracellular transport), increasing their concentration (27).
Mechanisms by which L-theanine may reduce doxorubicin adverse effects may include the variance of glutamate receptors expressed in normal and tumor cells. Whereas theanine binds the glutamate receptor in tumor cells, it is metabolized to glutamate in normal cells. This increase in glutamate likely results in increased efflux of doxorubicin from the cells, thereby decreasing toxicity (28). Animal models suggest prevention of doxorubicin-induced acute hepatotoxicity occurs via suppression of intrinsic caspase-3-dependent apoptotic signaling (24).
L-theanine does not induce or inhibit CYP450 enzymes (9).",L-Theanine | L-Theanine | Green tea,"Theanine | Gamma-glutamylethylamide | N-ethylglutamic acid | 2-Amino-4- (ethylcarbamoyl) Butyric Acid, 5-N-ethylglutamine, Gamma-ethylamino-L-glutamic acid, Gamma-glutamylethylamide, Gamma-N-ethylglutamine, L-gamma-glutamylethylamide, L-Theanine, L-Théanine, N-Éthyl-L-Glutamine, Teanina, Théanine.",L-Theanine | N-ethyl-L-glutamine | N-Ethyl-L-glutamine | Theanine,Theanine,L-Theanine,Theanine

Preliminary data suggest it has antiosteoporotic effects and enhances bone formation . Black cohosh by itself or in combination with other herbs may be effective for menopausal symptoms, although data are conflicting and an older meta analysis cited insufficient evidence to support its use . However, a more recent meta-analysis found isopropanolic black cohosh extract, an herbal medicinal product widely used in the EU as nonhormonal therapy, is comparable to low-dose transdermal estradiol or tibolone with a better benefit-risk profile than tibolone . Investigations of black cohosh for hot flashes due to breast cancer treatment also yielded mixed results , but supplementation may be effective for menopausal syndrome induced by luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue . In other studies, black cohosh did not enhance bone density, improve menopausal symptoms, nor improve 10-year risk of coronary heart disease in early postmenopausal women , although it has been reported to improve sleep . Preclinical data suggest black cohosh may decrease proliferation of prostate cancer cells and induce an apoptotic response in liver cells , but it also increased incidence of metastatic disease in mice . Whether it has similar effects in breast cancer patients is not clear, and a retrospective observational study of breast cancer patients found that isopropanolic black cohosh extract enhanced disease-free survival . Concomitant use of black cohosh with prescription medications has been associated with adverse drug reactions, most commonly involving abnormal hepatic function, hepatitis or hepatotoxicity . Black cohosh should not be confused with blue cohosh, which has a different medicinal profile. It is also not clear whether or not black cohosh acts as a phytoestrogen. Patients with breast cancer or at risk of breast cancer should consult with their physicians before taking it. | Black cohosh (Actaea racemose) is a woodland herb native to North America. The root is used as medicine and is often used for estrogen-related conditions. In some parts of the body, black cohosh might increase the effects of estrogen. In other parts of the body, black cohosh might decrease the effects of estrogen. Black cohosh should not be thought of as an ""herbal estrogen"" or a substitute for estrogen. People commonly use black cohosh for symptoms of menopause, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), painful menstruation, weak and brittle bones, and many other conditions, there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. Don't confuse black cohosh with blue cohosh or white cohosh. These are unrelated plants.","When taken by mouth : Black cohosh is possibly safe when taken appropriately for up to one year. It can cause some mild side effects such as stomach upset, headache, rash, and a feeling of heaviness. There is also some concern that black cohosh might cause liver damage in some people. People who take black cohosh should watch for symptoms of liver damage such as dark urine and fatigue. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Black cohosh is possibly unsafe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. It might increase the risk of miscarriage or affect a nursing infant. Breast cancer : There is some concern that black cohosh may worsen existing breast cancer. But this concern hasn’t been confirmed in scientific research. People who have breast cancer, have had breast cancer in the past, or are at high-risk for breast cancer, should speak with a healthcare professional before using black cohosh. Hormone-sensitive conditions, including endometriosis, fibroids, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, and others : Black cohosh acts somewhat like estrogen in the body. There is some concern that it might worsen conditions that are sensitive to estrogen. If you have a condition that could be affected by estrogen, speak with a healthcare professional before using black cohosh. Liver disease : Black cohosh might cause liver damage in some people.

Until more is known, people with liver disease should avoid taking black cohosh.","Black cohosh relieves menopausal symptoms likely by mimicking neurostransmitters: dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic and GABAergic effects have been demonstrated (49). It was believed to have estrogenic effects due to its ability to relieve menopausal symptoms in women (40), but studies show it has no effect on LH, FSH, prolactin, or estradiol levels (24). A black cohosh extract had antiproliferative and antiestrogenic effects in ER-negative cells, which suggests effects are mediated via an estrogen-independent pathway (25), possibly through HER-2 signaling (26).
In other studies, black cohosh repressed cyclin D1 and ID3 expression and inhibited proliferation of HepG2 p53-positive liver cells (43). In prostate cancer cells, antiproliferative effects occurred via impaired equilibrative nucleoside transporter activity, resulting in hindered nucleoside uptake (50). Black cohosh also induced apoptosis and suppressed estradiol-induced cell proliferation in human endometrial adenocarcinoma cells (55).

Iridoids, germacrane-type sesquiterpenoids, and lignans in valerian are associated with neuroprotective effects (3) (34). Valerian constituents also bind to various neurotransmitter receptors implicated in circadian rhythms and anxiety such as serotonin receptors (35). Preclinical studies found that anxiolytic activity is due to valerenic acid (VA) which could be inhibited by derivatives such as hydroxy-VA that do not modulate GABAA receptors (36). VA inhibits the enzyme system responsible for central catabolism of GABA, increasing GABA concentration and decreasing CNS activity, and direct binding of this constituent to GABA-receptors has been demonstrated (37). VA interaction with the GABAAergic system is similar to that of benzodiazepines (6). Sesquiterpenes and valepotriates were identified as having varying levels of antidepressant activity (7) (38). Chronic treatment of rodents with valepotriate-rich extract increased norepinephrine and dopamine levels (38). Valerian showed antispasmodic and hypotensive effects via potassium channel activation, which may be useful in gastrointestinal and cardiovascular disorders (5). It also protected against vasopressin-induced coronary spasm and pressor response, suggestive of coronary and systemic vasodilation (4).In healthy volunteers, valerian modulated intracortical facilitatory circuits (55).

DSI000228,Propolis,C0033488,"Propolis is a resinous mixture of pollen and beeswax collected by honeybees from the buds and exudates of certain trees and plants . It has been used in folk medicine, food, and beverages to improve health and prevent disease. Preclinical studies suggest antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunostimulatory, vasomodulatory, cardio- and radioprotective properties . It also demonstrated anticancer activities in several human cancer cell lines . Other experiments suggest it might enhance temozolomide effects in human glioblastoma cells . Data in humans are limited. Small trials suggest propolis may help treat warts , fungal foot infections , or diabetic foot ulcers . It may also reduce microbial counts and improve symptoms following periodontal treatment . A propolis/zinc suspension reduced the number of acute otitis media infections in children and supplementation with cranberry and propolis may help reduce the incidence of urinary tract infections . A double-blind RCT did not find benefit with Brazilian propolis for rheumatoid arthritis . In cancer settings, supplemental propolis was not useful for colon cancer prevention, and had negative effects on muscle tissues including myocardial cells . Its effects on chemotherapy-induced mucositis are thus far equivocal . Bee pollen, a constituent of propolis, is a mixture of plant pollens, nectar, and bee saliva that bees form into granules to store as food . It is claimed as a “cure all” by some and touted as having antioxidant, antiaging, and stamina-increasing properties. Aside from nutritional value, it had limited effects on athletic performance . Propolis or its constituents may also act as pro-oxidants , produce cytotoxic effects in normal cells , and/or have mutagenic activity , indicating that risk versus benefit needs further evaluation. | Propolis is a resin-like material made by bees from the buds of poplar and cone-bearing trees. Bees use it to build hives, and it may contain beehive byproducts. Propolis seems to help fight against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. It might also have anti-inflammatory effects and help skin heal. Propolis is rarely available in its pure form. It's usually obtained from beehives. People commonly use propolis for diabetes, cold sores, and swelling and sores inside the mouth. It's also used for burns, canker sores, genital herpes, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using propolis for COVID-19.","When taken by mouth : Propolis is possibly safe when used appropriately. It can cause allergic reactions, especially in people who are allergic to other bee products. Lozenges containing propolis can cause irritation and mouth ulcers. When applied to the skin : Propolis is possibly safe when used appropriately. It can cause allergic reactions, especially in people who are allergic to other bee products. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : There isn't enough reliable information to know if propolis is safe to use when pregnant. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Breast-feeding : Propolis is possibly safe when taken by mouth while breastfeeding. Doses of 300 mg daily for up to 10 months have been used safely. Stay on the safe side and avoid higher doses when breast-feeding. Bleeding conditions : A certain chemical in propolis might slow blood clotting. Taking propolis might increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding disorders. Allergies : Some propolis products might be contaminated with bee byproducts. Use propolis with caution if you are allergic to bee byproducts. Surgery : A certain chemical in propolis might slow blood clotting. Taking propolis might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop taking propolis 2 weeks before surgery.","In vitro studies have identified a number of active propolis constituents and potential mechanisms. Generally, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities are related to total phenolic contents (15). Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) and artepillin C are well-known anti-inflammatory components (25). The main active anticancer constituents are CAPE and chrysin (23). However, all of these constituents possess these other characteristics to some degree and vary with geographic origin.
CAPE specifically inhibits NF-kB (41). In human breast cancer cells, it also inhibits MDR gene expression, EGFR, and VEGF (20). CAPE decreased malignancy potential of breast cancer stem cells via inhibition of self-renewal, progenitor formation, and clonal growth, and significantly decreased CD44 expression (42). CAPE-initiated S- and G2/M-phase cell-cycle arrests and apoptosis in human cervical cancer lines was associated with increased E2F-1 expression (43).
The flavonoid chrysin demonstrated photoprotective effects by attenuating UVA- and UVB-induced apoptosis, ROS production, and COX-2 expression (44). Chrysin inhibits aromatase, an enzyme converting testosterone into estrogen (39), as well as histone deacetylase and HDAC8 enzymatic activity (23). Chrysin may overcome TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) resistance through Mcl-1 downregulation via STAT3 phosphorylation inhibition (45).
The phenolic compound artepillin C is the major constituent that stimulates pungent taste by activating TRPA1 channels (47). Immunomodulating effects are attributed to suppression of IL-2, IFN-γ and IL-17 expression in alloreactive CD4 T cells, suggesting potential to treat graft versus host disease (48). Artepillin C also sensitizes prostate cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by engaging both extrinsic receptor-mediated and intrinsic mitochondrial apoptotic pathways (21). In different tumor cell lines, artepillin C and baccharin were more cytotoxic than propolis, without additive or synergistic effects when combined (49).
Propolis as a whole modulates key inflammatory mediators of mRNA transcription, inhibiting specific inflammatory cytokines, and blocking NF-kB activation (55). Synergy between propolis and temozolomide in human glioblastoma cell lines is also partly attributed to reduced NF-kB activity (18). Propolis also inhibited proliferation of human leukemia cells via caspase-3 activation (2).
In animal models, propolis promotes wound healing via downregulation of type I allergy and inflammation (25) and modifying fibronectin metabolism (26). Immunomodulatory effects occur through increased toll-like receptor expression and IL-1β and IL-6 production (12). Pretreatment with orally-administered propolis extract reduced doxorubicin-induced oxidative damage to heart mitochondria (3). Diabetic hepatorenal damage was attenuated via antioxidant activity including free-radical scavenging, and was more pronounced in ethanol than water extracts (56).",Apis mellifera - secretion | Gum secreted by bee | Bee hive of the honey bee (Apis mellifera) | Apis mellifera - secretion,"Bee propolis | Propolis resin | Propolis wax | Bee glue | Bee putty | Acide de Cire d'Abeille, Baume de Propolis, Bee Glue, Bee Propolis, Beeswax Acid, Brazilian Green Propolis, Brazilian Propolis, Brown Propolis, Cire d'Abeille Synthétique, Cire de Propolis, Colle d'Abeille, Green Propolis, Hive Dross, Pénicilline Russe, Propóleos, Propolis Balsam, Propolis Cera, Propolis d'Abeille, Propolis Resin, Propolis Wax, Red Propolis, Résine de Propolis, Russian Penicillin, Synthetic Beeswax, Yellow Propolis.",Propolis | Green bee propolis | Bee Propolis | Bee propolis,Bee Propolis | Propolis,Propolis,Propolis

DSI000230,L-Leucine,C0023401,"Leucine is an essential amino acid that is not synthesized in the human body, and must be obtained from food consisting of plant or animal protein. It is often used together with valine and isoleucine (branched-chain amino acids, BCAA) in parenteral forms for nutritional support to maintain nitrogen balance and to treat cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. Purified leucine is marketed as a dietary supplement for body building. It is thought to stimulate protein synthesis by activating the mTOR pathway . In various animal models, leucine supplementation improved leptin sensitivity , lipid and glucose metabolism , exercise tolerance , acquired growth hormone resistance , disease-related skeletal muscle dysfunctions , and anemia . Although studies of leucine-containing products suggest potential benefit for improving muscle mass and strength across various populations, results are mixed , and a systematic review cites high heterogeneity across trial designs and formulas used . Other studies have shown that leucine does not affect glycemic control in elderly diabetic men , although in healthy subjects and in the presence of glucose, it stimulates insulin secretion and lowered blood glucose levels . Preliminary data suggest that essential amino acids with high levels of leucine may help prevent muscle loss in patients with non small-cell lung cancer . The addition of a leucine-rich supplement to a multimodal therapy also improved handgrip strength, but not other measures of physical functioning in advanced cancer patients .",,"Leucine is an essential branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) associated with skeletal muscle growth and maintenance, energy production, and generation of neurotransmitter and gluconeogenic precursors (35). It stimulates protein synthesis by activating the mTOR pathway (1), and is thought to enhance muscle anabolic signaling (11).
Animal models indicate that BCAA metabolism-related gene expression is regulated during adipocyte differentiation and influenced by nutrient levels, and leucine supplementation induces Bcat2 and Bckdha genes during early and late differentiation (35). Insulin sensitivity was improved in mice fed a high-fat diet by decreasing adiposity, rather than through direct action on peripheral target organs (36). Supplementation also improved lipid and glucose metabolism and restored leptin sensitivity in previously obese animals (19). However, in already-obese rats, leucine worsened adiposity by encouraging hypothalamic gene expression that favored fat accumulation (37). In another study, it did not reduce food intake or induce an anorectic pattern of hypothalamic gene expression (38). Co-ingesting leucine and glycine markedly attenuated glucose response, with only a modest increase in insulin response, suggesting their effects on glucose metabolism are partially insulin-independent (39). Leucine along with subtherapeutic levels of a PDE5 inhibitor altered lipid metabolism from storage to oxidation, improved glycemic control, and reversed hepatic steatosis induced by high-fat feeding (40).
Leucine supplementation speeds connective tissue repair and muscle regeneration by attenuating transforming growth factor-beta type I receptor and activating Smad2/3 (41). Antiatrophic effects were not mediated by its metabolite, beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl butyrate, and did not occur in dexamethasone-treated rats (42).
The ability of leucine to improve anemia in ribosomal protein-deficient cells occurs independently of TP53 (23). In Diamond-Blackfan anemia patients, leucine modulated protein synthesis by enhancing translation leading to improved hemoglobin levels (7). In the skeletal muscle of cirrhotic patients, an oral leucine-enriched BCAA mixture increased autophagy and reversed impaired mTOR1 signaling (24). Leucine may have a protective role in attenuating macrophage foam-cell formation, a hallmark of early atherogenesis, via mechanisms related to the metabolism of cholesterol, triglycerides, and energy production (49).","L-Leucine | Anas falcata - feather | L-Leucine | L-Leucine | Plant and animal proteins including dairy, fish, soy, meat, poultry, beans, and eggs",L-leucine | Leucinum | L-alpha-aminoisocaproic acid | Branched-chain amino acid (BCAA),L-Leucine | L-leucine | (S)-2-Amino-4-methylpentanoic acid | L-2-amino-4-methylvaleric acid,Creatyl-l-leucine | Glycyl-Alanyl-Lysine-L-Leucine | Glycine-alanyl-l-leucine | Glycyl-Alanyl-L-Leucine | Leucine | L-Leucine | Leucine tripeptide | leucine nitrate | leucine-alanine | N-acetyl leucine,Leucine,

It improved insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, and insulin signaling (15). It also reduced insulin resistance by influencing PPAR alpha and gamma expression (16) and by modulating phosphorylation status of insulin receptors and downstream signaling molecules (17). Preventive effects against insulin resistance may also occur via modulation of NF-kappa B and JNK pathways (36).
Animals fed bitter melon showed lower fatty acid synthase (18). It may affect fat and carbohydrate metabolism by stimulating thyroid hormones and adiponectin, and by enhancing AMPK activity (19). In another study, it prevented inflammation and oxidative stress, modulated mitochondrial activity, suppressed apoptosis activation, and inhibited lipid accumulation during the development of fatty liver (32).
Other experiments suggest cytotoxic activity with isolated components such as ribosome-inactivating proteins which inhibited HDAC-1 activity and induced apoptosis in prostate cancer cells (1). A triterpene extracted from bitter melon activated PPAR gamma and induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells (20). Bitter melon juice also caused apoptosis by inducing caspase-3 activation through AMPK in pancreatic cell lines (3).

DSI000257,Silver,C0037125,"Colloidal silver consists of silver particles suspended in a liquid. It is often produced by home-made generators. The use of silver medicinals to treat disorders such as epilepsy, gonorrhea, and colds was not uncommon until the mid-20th century. However, silver was replaced by safer therapies in the recent decades. It is not an essential mineral and does not serve any physiological function in the body. It denatures proteins by binding to their reactive groups and can inactivate some enzymes by forming hemisilver sulfides with sulfhydryl groups of the enzymes . A small study did not find any benefits of a colloidal silver nasal spray in improving recalcitrant chronic rhinosinusitis . Whereas silver compounds are still used in external preparations as antiseptics, there has been a growing interest in using the colloidal form, orally, as an alternative medicine. In vitro studies indicate antitumor effects , but no human data support the use of oral colloidal silver. Despite lack of evidence, it is being promoted as a cure for AIDS, cancer, and diabetes. Long term use can cause silver deposition in the skin and mucous membranes leading to an irreversible condition called argyria, characterized by bluish-gray to gray-black pigmentation . Other adverse effects include seizures . Pregnant women should not consume colloidal silver as it can cause developmental abnormalities in the fetus . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned companies marketing products, including colloidal silver, with false claims of preventing or treating the coronavirus disease COVID-19 . | Colloidal silver is a mineral. Colloidal silver products were once available as OTC drug products, but in 1999 the FDA ruled that they aren't safe. Colloidal silver can kill certain germs by destroying proteins, which is why it was previously used in wound dressings. But silver has no known function in the body and is not an essential mineral. Taking silver by mouth can cause the skin to turn a permanent bluish color. It can also cause brain function problems. Colloidal silver has been used for infections, hay fever, skin conditions, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any of its uses. There is also no good evidence to support using colloidal silver for COVID-19. It can be unsafe when taken by mouth, applied to the skin, or inhaled. | European silver fir is an evergreen, coniferous tree. People use fresh shoots, oil extracted from the needles, and extracts of the wood and bark to make medicine. People use European silver fir for the common cold, cough, swelling (inflammation) of the main airways in the lung (bronchitis), and sore throat, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Colloidal silver is likely unsafe. The silver in colloidal silver gets deposited into the skin and various organs. This can lead to a permanent bluish color that first appears in the gums. Areas of the skin exposed to the sun will become increasingly discolored. It can also damage organs. When applied to the skin : Colloidal silver is likely unsafe. The silver in colloidal silver gets deposited into the skin, which can lead to a permanent bluish color. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Colloidal silver is likely unsafe when taken by mouth or applied to the skin. Increased silver levels during pregnancy have been linked to abnormal development of the ear, face, and neck in the baby. Colloidal silver supplements can also lead to silver accumulation in the body, which can lead to a permanent bluish skin color. Silver can also be deposited in organs and cause serious damage. Don't use colloidal silver when pregnant or breast-feeding. | When taken by mouth : There isn't enough reliable information to know if European silver fir is safe or what the side effects might be.

DSI000258,Taurine,C0039350,"Taurine is a free amino sulfonic acid found in many tissues of mammals. In the bile, it conjugates with cholesterol to form soluble acids to facilitate excretion. Taurine also plays an important role in the functioning of cardiovascular, skeletal muscle, and nervous systems. Meat, seafood, and dairy products are rich sources, but it can also be synthesized in the body from cysteine . Vegetarians may have lower plasma levels of taurine due to reduced intake of meats . Taurine is marketed as a dietary supplement and is also a major ingredient in many energy drinks.In preclinical studies, taurine demonstrated neuroprotective effects , reduced diabetic-induced nephropathy , and improved glycemic control . Chronic taurine administration reversed muscle dysfunction and atrophy and decreased oxidative stress , and maternal taurine ingestion conferred protection against offspring developing adult hypertension .In humans, consumption of taurine-rich foods has been associated with lower cardiovascular risk . Evidence on whether taurine can improve exercise performance are mixed , and although taurine increased skeletal muscle in rodents, these results have not been duplicated in humans .A few studies in overweight or obese patients suggest taurine may reduce triglycerides and improve lipid metabolism , increase adiponectin levels, and decrease inflammation and lipid peroxidation . However, long-term supplementation did not affect insulin response or blood glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes . Other studies suggest potential decreases in blood pressure and benefit in older patients with congestive heart failure . It may also help manage muscle cramps in patients with chronic liver disease , prevent delirium following liver transplantation , improve cognitive function in dementia patients , and reduce stroke-like episodes in patients with a rare genetic disorder . Acamprosate, a taurine derivative, improved total abstinence and reduced heavy drinking in adults with alcohol use disorders . Other preliminary data suggest taurine co-administration reduced chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in acute lymphoblastic leukemia , but more studies are needed.Taurine has been associated with some adverse effects in animal models including increased infection risk , delayed learning and memory , and when coadministered with ethanol, drastic reductions in blood glucose resulting in death . In humans, adverse reactions have been reported from excessive ingestion of energy drinks with taurine and caffeine, and in combination with alcohol . | Taurine is a type of chemical called an amino sulfonic acid. It occurs naturally in the body. The best food sources are meat, fish, and eggs. Taurine has important functions in the heart and brain. It helps support nerve growth. It might also benefit people with heart failure by lowering blood pressure and calming the nervous system. This might help prevent heart failure from becoming worse. People take taurine for congestive heart failure (CHF) and swelling of the liver (hepatitis). It is also used for obesity, athletic performance, fatigue, diabetes, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse taurine with homotaurine. These are not the same.",When taken by mouth : Taurine is commonly consumed in foods. It is possibly safe when used as a medicine for up to 3 months. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Taurine is commonly consumed in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if taurine is safe to use as a medicine when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts. Children : Taurine is commonly consumed in foods. It is possibly safe when taken by mouth as medicine for up to 12 weeks.,"Taurine can be synthesized in the body by cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (1). It circulates in free form and is not incorporated into proteins. Taurine binds with cholesterol to form bile acid and protects the liver from alcohol-induced steatosis and lipid peroxidation (29). With respect to skeletal muscle, taurine facilitates Ca2+ dependent excitation–contraction processes, helps regulate cellular volume, and assists in antioxidant defense from stress responses (16). It also serves as a neurotransmitter (35) and crosses the blood-brain barrier by transporters (36). Taurine reduces glutamate excitotoxicity through regulation of calcium ions and mitochondrial energy metabolism (37). Its anti-apoptotic function is due to its inhibition of glutamate-induced membrane depolarization (38).In animal models, taurine reduced hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia by improving insulin sensitivity and leptin modulation (8). It also protected mitochondria of pancreatic islets from malnourishment damage (30). Renoprotective effects were attributed to decreases in proinflammatory cytokines and renal oxidative stress (31). It also inhibited glucose-induced apoptosis in vascular endothelial cells (32), and advanced glycation end products and fibrotic activity to prevent diabetic nephropathy (7).In humans, taurine protected against atherosclerotic disease by reversing endothelial abnormalities (33), and reduced blood pressure by decreasing the levels of plasma epinephrine (20).

DSI000261,Royal jelly,C0073603,"Royal jelly is a viscous substance secreted by worker bees and constitutes the essential food for queen bees and their larvae. It is consumed as a health food around the world. Preclinical studies suggest vasodilatory, hypotensive, antihypercholesterolemic, anti-inflammatory, and estrogenic effects , although its affinity for estrogen receptors is weaker compared with diethylstilbestrol . Royal jelly appeared to increase cytotoxic activity of temozolomide , but has also shown both inhibitory and proliferative effects. Animal studies suggest it may be helpful for colitis or to improve testosterone levels . Studies in humans are limited. Some suggest improved total serum lipid and cholesterol levels in those with moderately elevated levels , and improved erythropoiesis and glucose tolerance in healthy subjects . Other data suggest it may improve type 2 diabetes or cardiometabolic markers , but a meta-analysis determined that supplementation does not improve glucose levels , and quality of evidence is generally low . A combination supplement that contained royal jelly appeared to benefit patients with mild cognitive impairment . Other studies suggest that royal jelly supplementation may improve premenstrual and menopausal symptoms. It may also help preserve bone mineral density in postmenopausal women . Only a few studies have been conducted in cancer patients. Royal jelly swished, then swallowed, along with standard mouthwash therapy improved symptoms of oral mucositis and healing time in patients receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy . Another small study suggests benefit with topical royal jelly ointment in head and neck cancer patients . Because royal jelly has estrogenic effects , women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer should avoid this product. Prostate cancer patients should also use caution as royal jelly increased testosterone levels in animal studies . | Royal jelly is a milky secretion made by worker honeybees (Apis mellifera). It's rich in carbs, protein, amino acids, fatty acids, vitamins, and minerals. Royal jelly gets its name because it is used as food for the queen bee. Its composition varies depending on geography and climate. People use royal jelly for symptoms of menopause. It's also used for hay fever, diabetes, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), obesity, dry eye, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse royal jelly with bee pollen, beeswax, bee venom, honey, or propolis. Also don't confuse it with apitherapy. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : Royal jelly is possibly safe when used short-term. Doses of up to 4.8 grams daily have been used safely for up to 1 year. It's usually well-tolerated. But people with asthma or allergies might experience an allergic reaction. When applied to the skin : Royal jelly is possibly safe when used for up to 6 months. It might cause skin irritation and rash in some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if royal jelly is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Royal jelly is possibly safe when taken by mouth for up to 6 months in children 5-16 years of age. Asthma or allergies : Don't use royal jelly if you have asthma or allergies to bee products. It could cause some serious reactions, even death.","In animal models, anti-inflammatory effects with royal jelly were likely mediated by CD3-, CD5-, CD8- and CD45-positive T-cell immune responses (22). Protective effects against taxol-induced testicular damage were attributed to improved antioxidant status and E2f1 transcription factor upregulation (31).
Various mechanisms for cholesterol-lowering effects have been posited (5). Royal jelly may decrease reabsorption of cholesterol in the GI tract and increase its excretion in the bile due to the presence of phytosterols, mainly B-sitosterol. Another explanation offered is that royal jelly suppresses hepatic cholesterol synthesis (8).
Effects against oxidative stress are attributed to antioxidant peptides (24). Improved glucose tolerance and erythropoiesis occur from accelerated conversion of DHEA-S to testosterone via activation of 3β-HSD2 and/or 17β-HSD3 (32). In type 2 diabetic women, royal jelly supplementation reduced hemoglobin A1c and fasting blood glucose levels, increased insulin concentrations, and decreased oxidative stress via improvement of malondialdehyde levels, erythrocyte superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase activities (23).
Compounds identified in royal jelly exhibit weak estrogenic activity, but also inhibit binding of estradiol to estrogen receptor beta (4).

DSI000268,Lycopene,C0065331,"A natural pigment synthesized by plants and microorganisms, lycopene is used primarily as an antioxidant and to prevent and treat cancer, heart disease, and macular degeneration. Lycopene is classified as a non-provitamin A carotenoid, with other examples being lutein and zeaxanthin. Alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, and beta-cryptoxanthin are classified as provitamin A carotenoids because they can be converted into retinol. Small clinical trials suggest possible benefit against exercise-induced asthma and benign prostatic hyperplasia . However, no optimal dosage has been established. Data from observational studies indicate an inverse association of lycopene consumption with risk of developing cardiovascular disease , with a randomized study reporting endothelial function improvements in CVD patients but not healthy volunteers . Epidemiologic studies suggest an inverse relationship between lycopene consumption and cancer risk , particularly lung , stomach , prostate , and hormone-positive breast cancers . A consistent association between lycopene consumption and endometrial cancer risk has yet to be reported . Clinical data on lycopene supplementation for prostate cancer prevention remain inconclusive. Whereas low intake of tomato sauce was associated with advanced prostate cancer in patients with low-grade cancer at diagnosis , other studies indicate that lycopene or tomato-based regimens do not prevent prostate cancer , and that circulating carotenoids are not useful dietary intervention targets for prostate cancer prevention . In men with high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, a lycopene-rich extract did not confer any benefits , and high doses of lycopene, green tea catechins, and selenium were actually associated with higher prostate cancer incidence . Also, variable results were reported for lycopene supplementation in prostate cancer patients . In other studies, increasing lycopene intake altered serum metabolome of men at risk of prostate cancer by affecting reductions in pyruvate, higher levels of which increase the risk of prostate cancer . Intake of a tomato-soy juice resulted in nonsignificant decreases in prostate-specific antigen slope . Lycopene enhanced docetaxel efficacy against prostate cancer in animal models , and preliminary data in patients with metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer also suggest favorable activity with docetaxel plus lycopene . Given these mixed results, more studies are needed to determine whether lycopene has protective effects in prostate cancer. Furthermore, variation in genes related to carotenoid metabolism may also play a role in heterogeneous tissue responses to lycopene . Quality control of lycopene supplements has been an issue of concern. An analysis of six commercially available brands revealed that lycopene content varied from the labeled dosage by as much as 43% . | Lycopene is a type of organic pigment called a carotenoid. It is related to beta-carotene and gives some vegetables and fruits (e.g., tomatoes) a red color. Lycopene is a powerful antioxidant that might help protect cells from damage. It's found in tomato, watermelon, red orange, pink grapefruit, apricot, rose hip, and guava. Lycopene is used for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, cancer, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Lycopene is commonly consumed in certain fruits and vegetables. When taken in supplements, doses of 15-45 mg daily have been safely used for up to 6 months. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Lycopene is likely safe during pregnancy and breast-feeding when eaten in typical food amounts. There isn't enough reliable information to know if lycopene supplements are safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts. Surgery : Lycopene might slow blood clotting. It might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using lycopene supplements at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Lycopene is a natural pigment synthesized by plants and microorganisms. Referred to as a nonprovitamin A carotenoid, it is not known to have vitamin A activity. Biological actions include antioxidant activity via singlet oxygen quenching and peroxyl radical scavenging, induction of cell to cell communication, and growth control, although this appears to occur with less efficiency than with beta-carotene (15). Preventive consumption of lycopene attenuated effects of acetaminophen-induced liver injury in a murine model (29).
Proposed mechanisms of cancer-preventive effects include inhibition of cancer growth, induction of differentiation by modulation of cell cycle regulatory proteins, alterations in IGF-1 (16) or VEGF (17) levels, prevention of oxidative DNA damage, and possible enhancement of carcinogen-metabolizing enzymes (18). In human liver adenocarcinoma cells, antimetastatic activity was attributed to downregulation of NADPH oxidase 4, which produces ROS (30).
Other possible mechanisms for all carotenoids include immune enhancement as well as inhibition of mutagenesis and transformation, and premalignant lesions. Carotenoids are also associated with decreased risk for macular degeneration and cataracts, and some types of cancers and cardiovascular events (19).
Potential synergy of lycopene with docetaxel has been proposed to occur via downregulated IGF-I signaling inhibition and decreased survivin (37).","Lycopene extracted from tomato | Solanum lycopersicum - fruit | Solanum lycopersicum - fruit | Tomatoes, tomato products, watermelon, guava, rose hips, and pink grapefruit (15)","Nonprovitamin A carotenoid | All-Trans Lycopene, All-Trans Lycopène, Cis-Lycopène, Licopeno, Lycopène, Lycopenes, Lycopènes, Psi-Psi-Carotene, Psi-Psi-Carotène, (6E,8E,10E,12E,14E,16E,18E,20E,22E,24E,26E)-2,6,10,14,19,23,27,31-octamethyldotriaconta-2,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,30-tridecaene.","Lycopene | All-trans-lycopene | psi,psi-Carotene",Lycopene,Lycopene,Lycopene

DSI000277,Protease,C0030940,"Proteolytic enzyme (PE) treatments were first popularized in Germany in the 1960s for inflammation, osteoarthritis, autoimmune diseases, and viral infections. The products usually contain a mixture of pancreatin, papain, bromelain, trypsin, and chymotrypsin. Preclinical studies indicate that PEs have immunomodulatory and tumoricidal properties . Such effects are thought to result from degradation of abnormal immune complexes. In clinical studies, oral administration of PEs to healthy volunteers resulted in immunomodulatory effects . Systemic therapy with PE before and after exhaustive exercise increased maximal concentric strength and had favorable effects on inflammatory, metabolic, and immune biomarkers . In a randomized trial of subjects with moderate-to-severe knee osteoarthritis, oral PE had effectiveness comparable to diclofenac in relieving pain and increasing function . Although some clinical and epidemiological studies suggest benefit with adjuvant PEs in patients with head and neck cancers , multiple myeloma , breast cancer , and cervical cancer , conflicting data do not support the findings . A randomized controlled trial also failed to find sufficient evidence to support use of PEs for preventing mucositis . Further, results from a study involving patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer showed a decrease in overall survival and poorer quality of life with PEs compared with standard gemcitabine-based chemotherapy . Findings from two meta-analyses suggest that PEs may be useful for preventing acute radiation-induced skin reactions , but more studies are needed to confirm such effects. | Proteolytic enzymes (proteases) are enzymes that break down protein. These enzymes are made by animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria. Proteolytic enzymes break down proteins in the body or on the skin. This might help with digestion or with the breakdown of proteins involved in swelling and pain. Some proteolytic enzymes that may be found in supplements include bromelain, chymotrypsin, ficin, papain, serrapeptase, and trypsin. Proteolytic enzymes are used for a long list of conditions including cleaning wounds on the skin, help with digestion, pain and swelling, and many other conditions. Refer to specific topics for more information on uses and effects.",When taken by mouth : Proteolytic enzymes are possibly safe when taken appropriately. Side effects are usually mild or moderate and include stomach and intestinal complaints. See specific proteolytic enzymes for more detailed safety information. When applied to the skin : Proteolytic enzymes are possibly safe when applied to the skin. Some may cause allergic reactions. See specific proteolytic enzymes for more detailed safety information. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if proteolytic enzymes are safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.,"PEs are thought to exert immunomodulatory effects by causing increased release of reactive oxygen species by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (7) or by production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukins IL-6 and IL-1B that cause cytotoxic effects (1) (2). The anti-angiogenic effects exhibited by papain in VEGF-activated human endothelial cells are concentration-dependent and likely due to interference with AKT, MEK1/2 and SAPK/JNK phosphorylation (15). Bromelain has been shown to lower the tumorigenic/metastatic capacities of sarcoma L-1 cells (3). It also inhibited glioma cell migration and invasion by affecting expression of integrins, necessary for cellular migration and invasion (5). In B16 murine melanoma models, PEs inhibited metastasis by reducing expression of CD44 and CD54 molecules (6).",Aspergillus flavus var. oryzae - Whole | Bacterial protease | Aspergillus oryzae | Serratia marcescens | Fungal protease | Aspergillus flavus var. oryzae - Whole | Aspergillus oryzae | Bacillus subtilis | Fungal protease | Fungal protease | Fungal protease | Pineapple stem is a good source of bromelain.

The leaves and seed pods are nutritious and widely consumed as food while the bark and root are used in folk remedies for their perceived medicinal properties. Products derived from this botanical are used to treat a variety of conditions including asthma, diabetes, ulcers, infections, and cancer. In addition, the plant extracts are used in primitive water filtration systems to remove pollutants and algae . Preclinical studies suggest various properties with MO leaf, seed, and root extracts, including anticancer , hepatoprotective , hypoglycemic , anti-inflammatory , antibacterial , antifungal , antiviral , and antisickling effects. Models suggest potential to protect against Alzheimer’s disease and digestive ulcers , promote wound healing , and lower cholesterol levels . Studies in humans are quite limited. Preliminary findings suggest MO exerts a small positive effect on lipid profiles . An MO leaf powder increased insulin secretion in healthy subjects , and improved nutritional status and intake of AIDS patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy . Systematic reviews determined potential benefits of MO in cardiovascular or metabolic disorders and also cite the need for well-designed studies in diabetic or prediabetic patients .",,"Moringa is a nutritionally rich botanical with a high polyphenol content, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, and glucosinolates (48). In preclinical studies, fiber content of MO leaves mediated quercetin-3-glucoside to improve glucose tolerance (7) (12). Phenolic glycosides from the fruit show anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting nitric oxide (13). Dipeptide and urea derivatives from MO roots also have anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive effects (14). The ethanolic seed extract produced immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting leukocytes and splenocytes (15) as well as histamine release from mast cells (16).
In an animal model, MO root extract demonstrated protective effects on the liver and kidney in a dose-dependent manner (22). Hepatoprotective effects from acetaminophen toxicity may occur by maintaining glutathione levels (11). MO extract may protect against stomach ulcers by modulating 5-HT3 receptors (24) and lower cholesterol by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase (25).
Lab experiments suggest an array of other properties in this botanical. A leaf extract exhibited protective effects against Alzheimer’s disease by modulating brain monoamines (29). It also may help promote wound healing by increasing collagen deposits (30). Anticancer effects may occur via apoptosis (3) (4) and NF-kappaB inhibition (5) (46). In an animal model, an MO extract helped prevent chemically-induced tumor formation by increasing glutathione activity (6).
A moringa water extract showed hormone-modulating properties, stimulation of uterine and cervical epithelium metaplasia (26) (27), and antifertility effects (28). In a murine model, MO was genotoxic at supra-supplementation levels of 3,000 mg/kg body weight (39). In a case report of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome linked to ingestion of moringa, pathogenesis may be related to an immunomodulatory effect such as a delayed Th1-mediated hypersensitivity reaction (49).",Leaf | Moringa leaves are eaten in many parts of the tropics where the trees are found.,Horseradish tree | Drumstick tree | Benzolive tree | Ben oil tree,Moringa oleifera,,Moringa oleifera,

The seeds, commonly known as black seeds or black cumin, are used in cooking and in traditional medicine to reduce inflammation, as well as to treat infections and cancer.Constituents from N. sativa demonstrated immunomodulatory , antioxidant , antiparasitic and hepatoprotective effects in preclinical studies. Small clinical trials suggest benefits of seed extracts for the treatment of asthma , allergic diseases , rheumatoid arthritis , dyspepsia , H. pylori infection , diabetes , and for ameliorating hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease . Data on anti-hypertensive effects are conflicting . Thymoquinone, a major constituent, conferred antiepileptic effects in children with refractory seizures . Topical use of N. sativa oil reduced cyclical mastalgia , improved urinary incontinence in menopausal women , and both topical and oral use relieved osteoarthritic knee pain, but oral intake of N. sativa seed powder did not have similar benefit . Oral oil use improved metabolic parameters in patients with coronary artery disease and had cardiovascular protective effects in patients with type-2 diabetes .Thymoquinone and other constituents also showed anticancer effects . N. sativa oil, when injected, protected against radiation-induced tissue damage in a murine model . Oral intake of N. sativa seeds lowered the incidence of febrile neutropenia and length of hospital stay in children with brain tumors ; and topical application of an N. sativa gel decreased the severity of acute radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients . Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.",,"Thymoquinone, one of the chief constituents of N. sativa oil has antioxidant effects and restored the levels of lactate dehydrogenase, glutathione, and SOD in animal models (6) (7) (9). This may also explain its hepatoprotective effects (3) (4). Studies have also shown that N. sativa oil exerts anti-inflammatory properties by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase (18). Nigellone, a constituent of the crude seed extract, inhibited histamine release from rat peritoneal mast cells (10) and may reduce allergy symptoms in humans (12). N. sativa also decreased hypertension in rats likely via its diuretic effects (5), and decreased uterine smooth muscle contractions (14).The antioxidant effects of nigella are thought to protect tissues from radiation injury (15). However, it is not clear if this would also make radiation therapy less effective. Possible antitumor mechanisms of thymoquinone include inhibition of DNA synthesis (7), and promotion of apoptosis by inhibiting cell growth in G1 phase (8).

L-carnitine is important for heart and brain function, muscle movement, and many other body processes. The body can convert L-carnitine to other chemicals called acetyl-L-carnitine and propionyl-L-carnitine. But it's not clear whether the benefits of these other carnitines are the same. L-carnitine is used to increase L-carnitine levels in people whose natural level of L-carnitine is too low. Some people also use L-carnitine for conditions of the heart and blood vessels, serious kidney disease, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. | Propionyl-L-carnitine is a chemical naturally made in the body. It’s related to two other compounds called L-carnitine and acetyl-L-carnitine. Propionyl-L-carnitine helps the body produce energy. It’s important for heart function, muscle movement, and many other body processes. It also seems to help increase circulation. People use propionyl-L-carnitine for chest pain, heart disease, heart failure, athletic performance, chronic fatigue, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. Don't confuse propionyl-L-carnitine with acetyl-L-carnitine or L-carnitine. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : L-carnitine is likely safe when taken for up to 12 months. It can cause side effects such as stomach upset, heartburn, diarrhea, and seizures. It can also cause the urine, breath, and sweat to have a ""fishy"" odor. Avoid using D-carnitine and DL-carnitine. These forms of carnitine might block the effects of L-carnitine and cause symptoms that resemble L-carnitine deficiency. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : There isn't enough reliable information to know if L-carnitine is safe to use when pregnant. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Breast-feeding : Taking L-carnitine is possibly safe when taken by mouth while breast-feeding in the amounts recommended by a healthcare provider.

It's also used for heart disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), male-pattern baldness, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses. In the US, foods that contain at least 650 mg of beta-sitosterol are allowed to state that they might reduce the risk for heart disease.

DSI000321,Pollen,C0032385,"Pollen extract is an ingredient in a standardized Swedish natural product that contains both pollen and pistils derived from members of the Poaceae family of grasses. It has been used as an herbal remedy to relieve premenstrual, perimenopausal, and menopausal symptoms such as fatigue, hot flashes, irritability, and sleeplessness. Although the exact mechanism of action remains unclear, preclinical studies did not find estrogenic activity , suggesting it does not work by modulating hormones. This is of particular interest among patients with hormone-sensitive cancers who have limited options and may have safety concerns with more conventional methods to address such symptoms. Initial open-label studies suggested that a standardized pollen extract was useful in alleviating premenstrual, perimenopausal, and menopausal symptoms , although one of these studies combined the extract with royal jelly . In a follow-up randomized controlled trial, pollen extract reduced hot flashes and improve quality of life in menopausal women . A double-blind RCT found a reduction in premenstrual sleep disturbances, which was more pronounced in women who identified irritability as their main symptom . No studies have been conducted in cancer populations. Therefore, additional clinical trials are needed to confirm safety and efficacy of pollen extract, including for use among cancer patients. Pollen extract should not be confused with propolis, which is pollen harvested by bees from many different plant families, and may also include other substances such as beeswax.",,"There are two active ingredients in the formulation studied: a combined pollen and pistil extract (PI 82, 75%), which contains high levels of superoxide dismutase, and a pure pollen extract (GC FEM, 25%) (4). PI 82 pollen extracts are derived from Secale cereale (rye grass), Dactylis glomerata (orchard grass), and Pinus silvestris (Scots pine) while the pollen-pistil extract is derived from Zea mays. GC FEM pollen extract is derived from S. cereale, Z. mays, and P. silvestris  (1). The preparation is standardized to contain 14 mg of amino acids per tablet (4).
Laboratory studies determined that the pollen extract preparation used in studies contained low concentrations of the phytoestrogens daidzin, daidzein, and genistin, that were considered to be subeffective. These studies also did not detect genistein, formononetin, or biochanin A (1). In vitro, purified Swedish pollen extract did not show inhibition of CYP2D6 enzymes (6). Animal studies suggest that high doses of pollen extract do not cause uterine growth in immature female rats, suggesting no estrogenic effects (1).

There are several species of Ligustrum that are thought to have different medicinal properties . Traditionally, the plant is used to treat diminished eyesight, dizziness, fever, and insomnia. Some herbalists also use it to treat side effects caused by chemotherapy and to increase immune function in cancer patients. In vitro studies suggest that the fruits of Ligustrum lucidum have antitumor , immunomodulatory , antidiabetic , antiosteoporotic , antiviral , antimutagenic , hepatoprotective , and cytotoxic effects . In animal models, Ligustrum compounds showed antiosteoporotic and vision-sparing effects. Ligustrum combined with Siberian ginseng may have protective effects against chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression . Data in humans are quite limited. In a small study of non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, a formula containing reishi mushroom and Ligustrum was found to help maintain quality of life .",,"In vitro studies suggest antitumor effects occur via immunomodulation and by reverting macrophage suppression brought about by tumors (4), or are due to increases in phagocytes and lymphokine-activated killer cells (5). Ligustrum may induce apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells via p21 upregulation (17). Hepatoprotective effects are due to oleanolic acid and perhaps mediated by an increase in hepatic glutathione regeneration capacity (11).
Secoiridoid glucosides showed antioxidant effects against free radical-associated hemolysis of erythrocytes (1). The secoiridoid glucoside oleuropein has demonstrated antiviral activity against respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza type 3 virus (8) while other secoiridoid compounds showed activity against influenza A virus (16). The compound specnuezhenide may confer vision improvement effects via inhibition of HIF-1alpha/VEGF signaling pathway (20).
Salidroside and nuzhenide have been identified as potential antiosteoporotic compounds (15). In a murine model of diabetes-induced osteoporosis, ligustroflavone from Ligustrum fruit appeared to have protective effects via regulation of parathyroid hormone levels and improved calcium balance by acting on calcium-sensing receptors (19).",Ligustrum lucidum - Fruit,Privet | Nu zhen zi | Glossy privet | Dong qing zin,Ligustrum lucidum,,Ligustrum lucidum,

Other small studies suggest benefit for treating specific skin conditions , improving acute knee pain , and for alleviating postoperative pain, swelling and bleeding . However, data on whether it can reduce inflammation or relieve arthritis pain are mixed , and it does not appear to reduce fibrinogen or influence other cardiovascular disease risk factors .Bromelain demonstrated chemopreventive and antitumorigenic effects in preclinical studies. A formulation of alpha-Lipoic acid, Boswellia serrata, methylsulfonylmethane and bromelain improved symptoms of aromatase inhibitor-associated arthralgia in early breast cancer postmenopausal patients . A case report of prostate cancer patients found adjunctive use of bromelain with immunotherapy reduced PSA levels and stabilized the disease . Well-designed randomized trials are needed to evaluate the anticancer potential of bromelain. | Bromelain is a type of enzyme called a proteolytic enzyme. It is found in pineapple juice and in the pineapple stem. Bromelain causes the body to make substances that fight pain and swelling.

Surgery : Bromelain might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using bromelain at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Proteolytic removal of cell surface molecules by bromelain may account for some of its activities. Preclinical studies suggest it prevents platelet aggregation and adhesion to blood vessel endothelial cells (13). Anti-inflammatory effects are attributed to reduced levels of prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane A2 (9). In addition, bromelain inhibits neutrophil migration in response to IL-8 during inflammation (14) and decreases pro-inflammatory chemokine and cytokine secretion (15) (16).Oral enzymes such as bromelain have been proposed as additive agents for cancer therapy (8). Proposed mechanisms include downregulation of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-beta (7), direct inhibition of tumor cell growth, modulation of immune cell function and cell adhesion molecules, and the effects on platelet aggregation and thrombosis mentioned above (8) (9). Experiments with murine models suggest bromelain induces apoptosis-related proteins and inhibits NF-kappaB-driven Cox-2 expression by blocking MAPK and Akt/protein kinase B signaling (20). Bromelain also induced expression of autophagy-related proteins, light chain 3 protein B II, and beclin-1, thereby facilitating apoptosis in mammary carcinoma cells (26).",Ananas comosus var. comosus - Stem | Ananas comosus var. comosus - fruit | Ananas comosus var. comosus - fruit | Fruit(s) | Pineapple,"

It has been used in traditional medical systems as a remedy to relieve muscle and arthritic pain, and to treat cluster headaches and psoriasis. For these purposes, capsaicin is an active ingredient in some topical creams and nasal sprays. It is also available in a prescription-strength patch. Oral formulations are marketed largely for digestive and circulatory problems, poor appetite, and weight loss. (See Cayenne Pepper) Studies support benefits of topical low-concentration capsaicin formulations for psoriasis , prurigo nodularis , pruritus ani , and uremic pruritis . It is also conditionally recommended for osteoarthritis , and a meta-analysis suggests it may be as effective as topical NSAIDs for osteoarthritic pain , but its utility for rheumatoid arthritis remains inconclusive . An older clinical trial shows capsaicin 0.075% cream may control post-surgical pain in cancer patients . A case report in a palliative care patient using capsaicin 0.025% for opioid-refractory upper extremity pain also reported benefit . A high-concentration dermal capsaicin patch was shown safe and effective for postherpetic neuralgia , and was approved for prescription use. Data also suggest it is superior to pregabalin , and effective for diabetic and non-diabetic peripheral neuropathy, heterogenous neuropathic pain , and neuropathic pain arising from radiculopathies , but not HIV-associated neuropathic pain . A recent systematic review cites some benefit for both postherpetic neuralgia and HIV-neuropathy over controls. However, the patch is best used when other therapies have failed due to the small number of patients who may benefit (1 in 8) and unknown risks . Low-concentration capsaicin was determined as unlikely to have meaningful use for these conditions in clinical practice . Data are also limited in patients with post-mastectomy neuropathy . Preliminary findings suggest improvements in swallowing function in elderly patients with dysphagia with application of 0.025% capsaicin ointment to the external auditory canal . Topical capsaicin can also be effective for cannabis-associated hyperemesis . Only a few small studies suggest intranasal capsaicin of divergent formulations may be helpful for rhinitis , and its effectiveness for cluster headaches is unknown . There is continued controversy over whether capsaicin acts as a carcinogen, co-carcinogen, or anti-carcinogen . For example, capsaicin has demonstrated chemopreventive and antiproliferative effects against various cell lines including breast , bladder , prostate cancer cells . Also, a small study suggests utility of a high-concentration dermal capsaicin patch in relieving pain associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) . However, long-term topical application was shown to increase skin carcinogenesis in mice treated with a tumor promoter , although such effects may be concentration-dependent . Therefore, more studies are needed to clarify the roles of capsaicin in relationship to cancer.",,"The analgesic effect of capsaicin is multifactorial. It depolarizes C-fiber polymodal nociceptors (23) (24). This causes the release of substance P, the neurotransmitter that relays pain signals to the brain (25), which causes an initial increase in pain. With repeated application, pain subsides due to the eventual depletion of substance P at the afferent neurons (26). Capsaicin also activates transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1, also known as the capsaicin receptor) (27), causing selective and reversible defunctionalization of cutaneous sensory nerve endings expressing TRPV1 (28).
Improved swallowing function in elderly dysphagic patients, particularly glottal closure and cough reflex, was attributed to TRPV1-mediated aural stimulation of vagal Arnold’s nerve with capsaicin ointment (43). 
Studies on various cancer cell lines have shown that capsaicin demonstrates chemopreventive properties by causing cell-cycle arrest and inducing apoptosis, or by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depolarizing mitochondrial membranes, and through caspase activation (17) (19) (20). Alternatively, the co-carcinogenic effect of capsaicin on chemically-induced skin carcinogenesis is mediated through the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), but not TRPV1 (18). Further exploration of caspaicin-induced apoptosis, in glioma cells, found inhibition of autophagy to be a likely contributor (34). Interestingly, capsaicin was also shown to induce autophagy by enhancing the levels of autophagy markers LC3-II and Atg5, increasing p62 and Fap-1 degradation and increasing caspase-3 activity to induce apoptosis in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells (41).","Capsaicin | Cayenne peppers, hot sauces containing chili peppers",Capsaicin (topical formulations),(E)-8-Methyl-N-vanillyl-6-nonenamide | (6E)-N-[(4-Hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)methyl]-8-methyl-6-nonenamide | Capsaicin,Capsaicin,Capsaicin,

Shark cartilage extracts showed antiangiogenic and antitumor activities in vitro and in animal models , but clinical use remains controversial due to lack of bioavailability data and unsatisfactory patient outcomes in clinical trials . Shark cartilage has also been studied for Kaposi sarcoma , metastatic renal cell carcinoma , and multiple myeloma in early phase clinical trials. Neovastat (AE-941), a purified shark cartilage extract, did not improve survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer , but is effective against psoriasis . Most trials report low toxicity, but regular consumption of a shark cartilage supplement was associated with reversible hepatic dysfunction in a 57-year-old man . The Federal Trade Commission has barred manufacturers from making unsubstantiated claims of efficacy for their shark cartilage products . Shark cartilage should not be confused with bovine cartilage. | Shark cartilage is the tissue that provides support for fins in sharks (Squalus acanthias). It mainly comes from sharks caught in the Pacific Ocean. Shark cartilage became a popular medicine in the 1970s. But its popularity led to a decline in shark numbers. It was previously suggested that sharks don't get cancer, so consuming their cartilage might help prevent cancer in humans. But it is now clear that sharks do get cancer, and research hasn't shown benefits for cancer in humans. People use shark cartilage for cancer, scaly itchy skin (psoriasis), osteoarthritis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence supporting these uses. Don't confuse shark cartilage with bovine cartilage, or with chondroitin, which can be sourced from shark cartilage.","When taken by mouth : Shark cartilage is possibly safe when used for up to 40 months. It can cause a bad taste in the mouth, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, and constipation. When applied to the skin : Shark cartilage is possibly safe when used for up to 8 weeks.

Stay on the safe side and avoid use. ""Autoimmune diseases"" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions : Shark cartilage might cause the immune system to become more active. This could increase the symptoms of autoimmune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using shark cartilage. High calcium levels (hypercalcemia) : Shark cartilage contains calcium and might increase calcium levels. Do not use shark cartilage if you already have high calcium levels.","The glycoproteins sphyrnastatin 1 and 2 and other unidentified factors (1) are thought responsible for the activity of shark cartilage (SC), which shows strong antiangiogenic activity and inhibition of tumor neovascularization in numerous in vitro and animal studies (17). Theories for its mechanism include interference with endothelial cell migration and adhesion via modification of adhesion protein organization and inhibition of collagenase (18).
A murine glioma model suggests that induction of t-PA plays an essential role (19). Intraperitoneal administration suppresses sarcoma-180 growth and B16-F10 melanoma metastasis in mice (9) (11), but oral bioavailability is questionable based on the results of mouse models (20). The manufacturers of Neovastat (AE-941), a shark cartilage extract, report that this formulation inhibits embryonic vascularization  (21), endothelial cell proliferation (22), tubulogenesis, VEGF binding to endothelial cells, VEGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor, and the VEGF-dependent increase in vascular permeability in vitro. They also claim that it inhibits serine elastase and matrix metalloproteinase activity (23). Oral administration of Neovastat has produced anti-tumor effects in mouse models (10).

DSI000461,Theobroma cacao,C0939909,"Cocoa beans are the seeds of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao). The beans are used to make chocolate and are a source of many antioxidants. Cocoa contains a variety of chemicals, including antioxidants called flavonoids. It's not clear how these might work in the body, but they appear to relax the blood vessels. This could lead to lower blood pressure, and reduce inflammation and blockage of blood vessels. People most commonly use cocoa for heart disease and high blood pressure. It is also used for high cholesterol, memory, aging skin, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these other uses.","When taken by mouth : Eating cocoa is likely safe for most people. But keep in mind that cocoa contains caffeine and related chemicals, as well as heavy metals like lead. Eating large amounts might cause caffeine-related side effects such as nervousness, increased urination, sleeplessness, and a fast heartbeat. Cocoa can cause allergic skin reactions and might also trigger migraine headaches. It can also cause nausea, stomach discomfort, constipation, and gas. When applied to the skin : Applying cocoa butter to the skin is likely safe for most people. It can cause a rash in some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Cocoa is possibly safe when used in moderate amounts or in amounts commonly found in foods during pregnancy. But be sure to monitor your intake. Consuming cocoa in larger amounts is possibly unsafe because of the caffeine and heavy metals it contains. Caffeine found in cocoa crosses the placenta. High doses of caffeine during pregnancy might increase the risk for premature delivery, low birth weight, and miscarriage. Keep caffeine consumption below 300 mg per day during pregnancy. Chocolate products provide 2-35 mg caffeine per serving, and a cup of hot chocolate provides approximately 10 mg. So these products probably aren't a big concern. But unsweetened, dry cocoa powder can contain up to about 200 mg of caffeine per cup. Breast-feeding : Cocoa is possibly safe when used in moderate amounts or in amounts commonly found in foods while breast-feeding. Consuming cocoa in larger amounts is possibly unsafe because of the caffeine and heavy metals it contains. Breast milk concentrations of caffeine are thought to be about half the level of caffeine in the breast-feeding parent. If too much chocolate (16 oz per day) is consumed when breast-feeding, the nursing infant may become irritable and have frequent bowel movements because of the caffeine. Children : Dark chocolate products, which contain high amounts of cocoa, are possibly unsafe for children. These products can contain high levels of lead and cadmium, which can cause serious health issues in children. There isn't enough reliable information to know if other chocolate products, which usually contain lower amounts of cocoa, are safe in children. Anxiety : The caffeine in cocoa might make anxiety disorders worse when consumed in large amounts. Bleeding disorders : Cocoa can slow blood clotting. Consuming a lot of cocoa might increase the risk of bleeding and bruising in people with bleeding disorders. Heart conditions : Cocoa contains caffeine. The caffeine in cocoa might cause irregular heartbeat in some people and should be used cautiously in people with heart conditions. Diabetes : Cocoa seems to be able to raise blood sugar levels and might interfere with blood sugar control in people with diabetes. Diarrhea . Cocoa contains caffeine. The caffeine in cocoa, especially when taken in large amounts, can make diarrhea worse. Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) : Cocoa might make the symptoms of GERD worse. Glaucoma : Cocoa contains caffeine. The caffeine in cocoa increases pressure in the eye and should be used cautiously in people with glaucoma. High blood pressure : Cocoa contains caffeine. The caffeine in cocoa might increase blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. But for people who consume caffeine regularly, it might not be a big increase. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) : Cocoa contains caffeine. The caffeine in cocoa, especially when taken in large amounts, can make diarrhea and IBS symptoms worse. Rapid heartbeat : Cocoa from dark chocolate can increase heart rate. Seizures : Cocoa contains caffeine. High doses of caffeine might cause seizures or decrease the effects of drugs used to prevent seizures. If you have ever had a seizure, don't use high doses of caffeine or caffeine-containing products such as cocoa. Weak bones (osteoporosis) : Cocoa contains caffeine. The caffeine in cocoa might increase how much calcium is released in the urine.

The mushroom extract inhibits expression of cell-cycle regulatory genes and suppresses metastatic behavior via inhibition of cell adhesion, migration, and invasion. Antiproliferative effects were linked to suppression of urokinase plasminogen activator (15). PSP also inhibits interaction between HIV-1 gp120 and CD4 receptor, HIV-1 transcriptase activity, and glycohydrolase enzyme activity associated with viral glycosylation (16).

DSI000521,Cocos nucifera,C0009210,"Coconut (Cocos nucifera) is the fruit of the coconut palm, which grows in tropical places around the world. It can be eaten as food or used as medicine. Coconuts contain a high amount of a saturated fat called medium chain triglycerides. These fats work differently than other types of saturated fat in the body. They might increase fat burning and reduce fat storage. Coconut flour, which is made from coconut, contains high amounts of dietary fiber. People use coconut for diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don’t confuse coconut with coconut oil or coconut water. These are not the same. | Coconut water is the clear liquid found inside immature coconuts (Cocos nucifera). As the coconut matures, the water is replaced by coconut meat. Coconut water is rich in carbohydrates and electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium. Because of these electrolytes, there’s a lot of interest in using coconut water to treat and prevent dehydration. Coconut water is sometimes called green coconut water because the immature coconuts are green. People commonly use coconut water as a beverage and as a solution for treating dehydration related to diarrhea or exercise. It’s also used for high blood pressure and athletic performance, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don’t confuse coconut water with coconut or coconut oil. These are not the same. Also, coconut water is different than coconut milk. Coconut milk is made from a mixture of the grated meat of a mature coconut.","When taken by mouth : Coconut is commonly consumed as food. Coconut is possibly safe when used as medicine, short-term. In some people, eating coconuts might cause an allergic reaction. Symptoms might include skin rashes and difficulty breathing. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Coconut is commonly consumed as food. There isn't enough reliable information to know if coconut is safe to use as medicine when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts. Allergy to coconut oil or related plants : Coconut might cause serious allergic reactions in people who are allergic to coconut oil, coconut palm pollen, components of coconut, or other members of the Arecaceae plant family. High cholesterol : People who eat large amounts of coconut have higher cholesterol than those who eat less. But eating foods with coconut flour might actually decrease cholesterol levels. This might be due to the type of coconut product used. Whole coconut contains coconut oil, which is made up of saturated fat. But coconut flour is processed to remove fats. Use whole coconut cautiously if you have high cholesterol. Surgery : Coconut might interfere with blood glucose control during and after surgery. Stop using coconut at least two weeks before a scheduled surgery. | When taken by mouth : Coconut water is commonly consumed as a drink and is likely safe. It’s usually well-tolerated. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Coconut water is commonly consumed as a drink. There isn't enough reliable information to know if coconut water is safe to use as medicine when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Coconut water is commonly consumed as a drink and seems to be safe for children. As medicine, it’s possibly safe when used appropriately. Cystic fibrosis : Cystic fibrosis can lower salt levels in the body. Some people with cystic fibrosis need to take fluids or pills to increase salt (sodium) levels. Coconut water doesn’t contain enough salt to increase salt levels in people with cystic fibrosis. Also, it might contain too much potassium. Don't drink coconut water as way to increase salt levels if you have cystic fibrosis. High levels of potassium in the blood : Coconut water contains high levels of potassium. Don't drink coconut water if you have high levels of potassium in the blood. Kidney problems : Coconut water contains high levels of potassium. Normally, potassium is excreted in the urine if blood levels get too high. But this doesn’t happen if the kidneys aren’t working normally.

It is marketed as a dietary supplement for this reason, and is also used as adjuvant therapy for neuropathy and to improve glycemic control. Preclinical studies show that ALA plays a crucial role in energy production, and exerts antioxidant and apoptotic effects . Studies on ALA in humans have been conducted across various populations. Preliminary data suggest long-term supplementation may help preserve walking ability in patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis, especially those with less disability at baseline . Studies of intravenous and oral forms suggest improved insulin sensitivity, vasodilation, and neuropathy symptoms in diabetic patients , although earlier studies to determine its role in reversing neuropathies and liver disease produced mixed results. Data from a double-blind RCT suggest short-term ALA supplementation can be beneficial for idiopathic pain without altering glycemia in patients with normal levels , but another trial did not find it helpful for fibromyalgia . In women with gestational diabetes, oral ALA may improve liver function and glucose metabolism . Meta-analyses also suggest ALA supplementation may reduce inflammatory mediators such as CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, and improve some glucose and lipid parameters , but confirming studies are needed. In other preliminary studies, ALA induced mild weight loss and waist circumference reduction in overweight or obese subjects . Long-term use of R-ALA, which has increased bioavailability, produced modest weight loss in overweight/obese adults without significant reductions in triglyceride levels . In postoperative settings, ALA helped improve wound healing and scarring in women undergoing cesarean section , and reduced pain after carpal tunnel decompression . In patients with atrial fibrillation, it reduced serum markers of inflammation but not AF recurrence after ablative treatment . Although current data suggest protective effects of antioxidants against Alzheimer’s disease, such effects were not found with a combination of coenzyme Q, vitamin C, vitamin E, and ALA . And even though preclinical studies of ALA demonstrate antioxidant properties with efficacy in neurodegenerative models, oral ALA was ineffective in patients with geographic atrophy from advanced macular degeneration . High doses of ALA can cause hypoglycemic symptoms and other serious conditions. ALA may also antagonize the effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy because of its antioxidant properties. | Alpha-lipoic acid is an antioxidant that is made naturally in the body and also found in foods. It is used to break down carbohydrates and to make energy. Alpha-lipoic acid can be eaten in foods, such as red meat, carrots, beets, spinach, broccoli, and potatoes. It is also available in supplements. Because alpha-lipoic acid seems to work like an antioxidant, it might provide protection to the brain and also be helpful in certain liver diseases. People most commonly use alpha-lipoic acid for nerve pain in people with diabetes. It is also used for obesity, altitude sickness, aging skin, high levels of cholesterol or other fats in the blood, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses.","When taken by mouth : Alpha-lipoic acid is possibly safe for most adults when taken for up to 4 years. It is usually well-tolerated. The most common side effects are headache, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting. When applied to the skin : Alpha-lipoic acid is possibly safe for most adults when used as a cream for up to 12 weeks. It might cause a rash in some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : When taken by mouth, alpha-lipoic acid is possibly safe. It's been used safely during pregnancy in doses of up to 600 mg daily for up to 4 weeks. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if alpha-lipoic acid is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Alpha-lipoic acid is possibly safe in children aged 10-17 years when taken by mouth in doses up to 600 mg daily for 3 months. But it is possibly unsafe for children to take large amounts of alpha-lipoic acid by mouth. Seizures, vomiting, and unconsciousness have been reported for children aged 14 months to 16 years who took up to 2400 mg of alpha-lipoic acid as a single dose. Surgery : Alpha-lipoic acid can decrease blood sugar levels. Alpha-lipoic acid might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop taking alpha-lipoic acid 2 weeks before elective surgical procedures. Excessive use of alcohol/thiamine deficiency : Alcohol can lower the amount of thiamine (vitamin B1) in the body. Taking alpha-lipoic acid when there is a shortage of thiamine might cause serious health problems. If you drink a lot of alcohol and take alpha-lipoic acid, you should take a thiamine supplement.","ALA acts as a lipophilic free radical scavenger. Dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA), a reduced form of ALA, has more antioxidant effects. It can assist in repairing oxidative damage and regenerate endogenous antioxidants such as vitamin C, vitamin E, and glutathione. Both DHLA and ALA also have metal-chelating capacities. As a lipoamide, ALA functions as a cofactor in various multienzyme systems involved in the decarboxylation of alpha-keto acids such as pyruvate (13) (14) (15).
ALA produced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phases in FaDu and Jurkat human tumor cell lines (1). It also scavenged ROS in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, followed by cell growth arrest and apoptosis (16). In another study, ALA induced cell death in colorectal cancer cells independent of their p53 status, and enhanced cytotoxicity of 5-fluorouracil (22).
In healthy controls and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis patients, ALA appears to stimulate cAMP production (36). In critically ill patients, ALA reduced oxidative stress and improved insulin resistance (37).","R-alpha-Lipoic acid | Adipic acid | Lipoic acid | DL-alpha-Lipoic acid | DL-alpha-Lipoic acid | Organ meats, spinach, broccoli, tomato, peas, Brussels sprouts, rice bran","Thioctic acid | Lipoate | Lipoic acid | ALA | Thioctan | A-Lipoic Acid, Acetate Replacing Factor, Acide Alpha-Lipoïque, Acide Alpha-Lipoïque R, Acide DL-Alpha-Lipoïque,Acide Lipoïque, Acide Thioctique, Acide 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoïque, Acide 1,2-dithiolane-3-valérique, Acide 5 Valérique (1,2-dithiolan-3-yl), Acide 6,8-dithiooctanoïque, Acide 6,8-Thioctique, Acido Alfa Lipoico, ALA, Biletan, DHLA, Dihydrolipoic Acid, Extrait d'acide Alpha-Lipoïque, Lipoic Acid, Lipoicin, R-ALA, R-Alpha-Lipoic Acid, (+-)-1,2-Dithiolane-3-Pentanoic Acid, (R)-Dithiolane-3-Pentanoic Acid,R, S-Alpha Lipoic Acid, (R)-Lipoic Acid, R-Lipoic Acid, RS-Alpha-Lipoic Acid, S-Alpha-Lipoic Acid, S-Lipoic Acid, Sodium-R-Lipoate, Thioctacid, Thioctan,Thioctic Acid.","1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid | 1,2-Dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid, (R) | Alpha lipoic acid | 1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid, (R) | (+-)-1,2-Dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid | Thioctic Acid | Lipoic acid | (±)-1,2-Dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid | 1,2-dithiolane-3-valeric acid | (+)-1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid | R-a-lipoic acid | Thioctic acid | (R)-1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid | Thioctic acid dl-form | Alpha Lipoic Acid | R-alpha-lipoic acid",Alpha-Lipoic Acid | Alpha Lipoic Acid | Lipoic Acid | Zinc lipoic acid,Alpha-Lipoic Acid,Alpha-Lipoic Acid

It is found in all human cells, with higher concentrations found in the liver, kidney, heart, and pancreas. It is also consumed as a dietary supplement for its antioxidant effects and is often promoted as a preventive agent for cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson’s disease, infertility, and cancer. Studies using murine models suggest antioxidant and neuroprotective effects , and the potential to alleviate radiation-induced nephropathy .Data from some human studies suggest CoQ10 may benefit patients with coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure , and reduce risk of cardiovascular mortality . Other studies using a combination of selenium and CoQ10 also suggest improved cardiac function and reduced mortality risk . However, a systematic review concluded that current evidence does not support routine CoQ10 supplementation in patients with coronary heart disease . According to the American Heart Association, large-scale randomized trials are needed to definitively determine the value of supplementation in managing heart failure .Observations that patients on statins have decreased CoQ10 concentrations in muscle cells resulted in efforts to evaluate CoQ10 for statin-induced myalgias, but data are inconclusive . Short-term CoQ10 supplementation in diabetic hemodialysis patients improved markers of insulin metabolism, but not fasting glucose, HbA1c, or lipid profiles . Supplementation may also reduce pain in those with diabetic neuropathy . A meta-analysis concluded that evidence of benefit in diabetic kidney disease is limited and additional study is needed . Also, supplementation did not improve work efficiency in patients with chronic kidney disease .CoQ10 may be helpful in some cases for migraine prevention . A small study found reduced migraine frequency following supplementation , and other data suggest it may reduce number of migraine days and duration, but not number of attacks or severity . A randomized trial of add-on supplementation in pediatric migraine failed to find benefit .Although neuroprotective effects have been reported in small trials , larger well-designed trials have not shown benefit with CoQ10 supplementation in Parkinson’s or Huntington’s disease . In other studies, adjuvant CoQ10 improved depressive symptoms in patients with bipolar disorder , but an antioxidant mixture including CoQ10, vitamins C and E, and alpha-lipoic acid was ineffective against Alzheimer’s disease .Some data suggest CoQ10 supplementation may increase sperm motility in men , modulate expression of insulin, lipid, and inflammatory markers in women with polycystic ovary syndrome , and reduce fatigue . It may also help reduce reduce some measures of oxidative stress , and inflammatory markers in general population and in patients with chronic diseases . In patients with sepsis, supplementation in the early phase improved clinical parameters and mitochondrial dysfunction .CoQ10 has also been investigated in cancer patients. Preliminary studies on whether it can help control cancer-related fatigue are mixed . In patients on tamoxifen therapy, CoQ10 appeared to lower inflammatory cytokine levels . CoQ10 levels have been positively associated with antioxidant capacity and negatively correlated with inflammation markers post-surgery in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma . However, antioxidant supplementation including CoQ10 before and during treatment was associated with an increased hazard of recurrence in breast cancer patients . More research is needed .CoQ10 may interfere with the actions of warfarin . Because of its antioxidant properties, it may also reduce effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation therapy . | Coenzyme Q10 is a vitamin-like substance required for the function of many organs in the body. It is eaten in small amounts in meat and seafood. Coenzyme Q10 helps provide energy to cells. It also seems to have antioxidant activity. People with certain diseases, such as heart failure, high blood pressure, Parkinson disease, blood infections, and HIV infection, might have lower levels of coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q10 can also be made in a laboratory. People most commonly use coenzyme Q10 for conditions that affect the heart such as heart failure and fluid build-up in the body, chest pain, and high blood pressure. It is also used for migraine headache, Parkinson disease, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses.","When taken by mouth : Coenzyme Q10 is likely safe for most adults. While most people tolerate coenzyme Q10 well, it can cause some mild side effects including stomach upset, loss of appetite, nausea, and diarrhea. It can also cause allergic skin rashes in some people. When applied to the skin : Coenzyme Q10 is likely safe for most adults when applied directly to the gums. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Coenzyme Q10 is possibly safe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. Coenzyme Q10 has been used safely when taken twice daily starting at the 20 th week of pregnancy. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if coenzyme Q10 is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Coenzyme Q10 is possibly safe for children when taken by mouth under the supervision of a healthcare professional.","CoQ10 is known to have antioxidant and membrane-stabilizing properties and is the only endogenously produced lipid with a redox function in mammals. All cells are capable of synthesizing CoQ10 and no redistribution between organs occurs through the blood. It is necessary for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and its role as a mobile electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron-transfer processes of respiration and coupled phosphorylation is well established. It also has a direct regulatory role on succinyl and NADH dehydrogenases (1). CoQ10 scavenges free radicals produced by lipid peroxidation and prevents mitochondrial deformity during ischemic episodes, and may help maintain integrity of myocardial calcium ion channels during ischemic insults (2). CoQ10 may also stabilize cellular membranes and prevent depletion of metabolites required for ATP resynthesis (10), and suppress age-related inflammatory reactions and osteoclast differentiation by inhibiting oxidative stress (30). One of the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effects of CoQ10 involves inhibition of microglia in pentylenetetrazol-induced kindling epilepsy in mice (40).Other preclinical studies suggest CoQ10 can prevent reduced glucose transporter-4 protein levels in adipocytes caused by simvastatin, which may contribute to the risk of new-onset diabetes in patients on statins (31). It also reduced high glucose-induced apoptosis and dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells by upregulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase and heme oxygenase via the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway (41). In a murine model, it protected against doxorubicin-induced testicular toxicity by ameliorating oxidative stress, reducing apoptosis, and upregulating testicular P-glycoprotein (32).",Yeast fermentation process | Bacteria,"Ubiquinone | Ubidecarenone | Ubiquinol | CoQ | CoQ10 | Co Q10, Co Q-10, Coenzima Q-10, Co-Enzyme 10, Coenzyme Q 10, Coenzyme Q10, Co-Enzyme Q10, Co-Enzyme Q-10, Co-Q 10, CoQ10, Co-Q10, CoQ-10, Ubidecarenone, Ubidécarénone, Ubiquinone-10.","Ubiquinone | Coenzyme Q10 | Microorganismes CoQ10 - Cellule entière pour biosynthèse  | Ubidecarenone | Coenzyme Q10, ubidecarenone",Coenzyme Q-10 | Coenzyme Q10 | CoQ10,Coenzyme Q10,Coenzyme Q10

DSI000569,Flaxseed,C0023753,"Flaxseed, rich in omega-3 fatty acids and phytoestrogenic lignans, is used in traditional medicine to treat coughs, colds, constipation, urinary tract infections, and as a topical demulcent and an emollient. In clinical studies, flaxseed improved mild menopausal symptoms ; and exerted chemoprotective effects along with affecting moderate reductions in estrogens and androgens in postmenopausal women. It may also benefit women with polycystic ovarian syndrome by reducing androgen levels ; and flaxseed powder combined with Vitex agnus may help reduce cyclical mastalgia . Supplementation with a major lignan derived from flaxseed improved glycemic control in Type-2 diabetic patients . But it was ineffective in reducing hot flashes in postmenopausal women with or without breast cancer . In other studies, flaxseed products were found to reduce blood pressure but did not improve insulin resistance or glycemic indices in pre-diabetic patients although conflicting data suggest otherwise . Supplementation along with lifestyle modification was more effective than lifestyle modification alone to manage metabolic syndrome and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . Systematic reviews determined that flaxseed may have a role in decreasing appetite and hunger and in preventing cardiovascular events by inhibiting platelet aggregation . It was also found more effective than lactulose and psyllium for improving symptoms of constipation . In patients with ulcerative colitis, both flaxseed and flaxseed oil may affect reductions in systemic inflammation as well as disease severity . In addition, daily flaxseed oil consumption significantly decreased inflammatory markers related to cardiovascular disease , and may help reduce bone resorption in hemodialysis patients. Flaxseed was also shown to confer renoprotection in patients with lupus nephritis ; and may benefit patients with rheumatoid arthritis . Although flaxseed-derived lignan reduced blood glucose levels in hypercholesterolemic individuals , data on its cholesterol-lowering effects are mixed . Preclinical studies suggest that flaxseed may inhibit growth and metastasis of human breast , prostate cancers and melanoma ; and reduce radiation therapy-induced lung damage and improve survival . It was also shown to lower tumor biomarkers in patients with prostate and breast cancer ; and may confer protection against radiation-induced adverse effects in lung cancer patients although such effects could not be accurately determined due to poor tolerability of flaxseed . In other studies, a flaxseed extract was ineffective in preventing oral infection following radiation treatment in head and neck cancer patients ; and supplementation with secoisolariciresinol diglucoside, a lignan, was not superior to placebo in reducing proliferation in benign breast tissue of premenopausal women at increased risk of breast cancer . Flaxseed ingestion can increase urinary lignan excretion and the length of luteal phase of the menstrual cycle . Because flaxseed has phytoestrogenic effects, patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer should consult their physicians before using it. | Flax (Linum usitatissimum) is a food and fiber crop. Flaxseeds are a good source of dietary fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, including alpha-linolenic acid. Flaxseeds also contain phytoestrogens called lignans, which are similar to the hormone estrogen. The fiber in flaxseed is found in the seed coat. When taken before eating, it seems to make people feel less hungry. It might also help limit how much cholesterol the body absorbs from food. Flaxseed is used for constipation, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, and swelling of the kidneys in people with lupus. It is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses. Flaxseed and flaxseed oil have different effects. For information about the oil, see Flaxseed Oil.","When taken by mouth : Flaxseed is likely safe for most adults. Adding flaxseed to the diet might increase the number of bowel movements each day. It might also cause side effects such as bloating, gas, stomachache, and nausea. Higher doses are likely to cause more side effects. Taking flaxseed extracts that contain lignans is possibly safe. Flaxseed lignan extracts can be used safely for up to 6 months. Taking raw or unripe flaxseed by mouth is possibly unsafe. It might be poisonous. When applied to the skin : Flaxseed is possibly safe when used in a cloth on the skin. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Taking flaxseed by mouth during pregnancy is possibly unsafe. Flaxseed can act like the hormone estrogen. Some healthcare providers worry that this might harm the pregnancy. But there is no reliable clinical evidence about its effects on pregnancy. Until more is known, stay on the safe side and avoid use. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if flaxseed is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Hormone-sensitive cancers or conditions : Because flaxseed might act somewhat like the hormone estrogen, it might make hormone-sensitive conditions worse. Some of these conditions include breast and ovarian cancer. Until more is known, avoid taking large amounts of flaxseed if you have one of these conditions. High triglyceride levels (hypertriglyceridemia) : Partially defatted flaxseed, which contains less alpha linolenic acid content, might increase triglyceride levels. If your triglyceride levels are too high, don't take this type of flaxseed. Surgery : Flaxseed might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using it at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Flaxseed is the most concentrated food source of the plant lignan, secoisolariciresinol, a precursor for enterolactone. It is thought that phytoestrogenic lignans contribute to the plant’s hormonal effects (4). Flaxseed has been shown to affect the length of the menstrual cycle in premenopausal women (5). It may also alter estrogen metabolism, increasing the ratio of 2-hydroxyestrogen to 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone in a dose-dependent fashion (2). The renoprotective effects of flaxseed are thought to be due to high concentration of alpha-linolenic acid, an omega-3 fatty acid precursor (3) or through inhibition of angiogenesis, tyrosine protein kinases, and cytokine-induced activation of transcription factors (16). The laxative effects of flaxseed are likely due to its fiber content (22).
Animal studies suggest inhibition of growth and metastasis of established human breast cancer with flaxseed is due in part to downregulation of insulin-like growth factor I and expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (6). Flaxseed also induced apoptosis by significantly upregulating p53 mRNA in breast cancer cell lines (29). In another study, flaxseed oil enhanced effects of trastuzumab in reducing HER2 signaling via Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, resulting in reduced cell proliferation and increased apoptosis (33). Inhibition of cell proliferation with flaxseed was also reported in models of prostate cancer (7).
In human studies, dietary flaxseed reduced central aortic blood pressure through changes in plasma oxylipins (40) (41). Other studies suggest hormonal effects may play a role in the ability of flaxseed to modulate prostate cancer biology and associated biomarkers (9), and lower serum lipid levels in postmenopausal breast cancer (10).",Linum usitatissimum - Seed | Milled seed,"Flax | Linseed | Lint bells | Linum | Alasi, Aliviraaii, Brown Flaxseed, Brown-Seeded Flax, Common Flax, Echter Lein, Flachs, Flachssamen, Flax, Flax Hull, Flax Lignans, Flax Meal, Flax Seed, Gemeiner Flachs, Golden Flax, Graine de Lin, Kattan, Keten, Leinsamen, Lignanes de Lin, Lignans, Lin, Lin Commun, Lin Oléagineux, Lin Textile, Linaza,  Lini Semen, Linho, Lino, Lino Comune, Lino Mazzese, Lino Usuale, Linseed, Linseed Flax, Lint Bells, Linum, Linum crepitans, Linum humile, Linum usitatissimum, Malsag, Phytoestrogen, Phyto-œstrogène, Saatlein, Ta Ma, Tisii, Winterlien.",Flaxseed Protein | Flaxseed,Flaxseed Fiber | Flaxseed | Flaxseed Protein,Flaxseed,Flaxseed

Other small studies suggest bovine colostrum supplementation may reduce GI problems including diarrhea in ICU-hospitalized patients and in children . There is also some data suggesting it may prevent gastrointestinal damage caused by NSAIDs or help treat distal colitis . In perioperative settings, data suggest that oral bovine colostrum may reduce endotoxemia in patients undergoing abdominal surgery and postoperative plasma C-reactive protein levels in patients undergoing coronary bypass surgery . Although it is thought to have immunological benefits, meta-analyses found a lack of evidence for colostrum in either preterm infants or physically active adults . Evidence is also lacking on whether it could help prevent hemolytic uremic syndrome from E. coli infections .

Wild yam has antiproliferative and antimitotic effects in vitro. Animal models suggest antinociceptive, anti-inflammatory, and antidiabetic effects . In other preclinical studies, the active constituent diosgenin had estrogenic and progestogenic effects and restored moderately decreased sperm motility in mice . Dioscorin, another protein, appeared to reduce weight gain and total visceral lipids, and improve impaired glucose tolerance in mice . Small studies on whether wild yam can relieve menopausal symptoms are mixed: one suggested that an oral D. alata formula was more effective than placebo , but another showed a topical D. villosa formula was ineffective . In other small studies, an oral diosgenin-rich yam extract appeared to enhance cognitive function , and sex hormone and lipid profiles appeared to improve with dietary yam intake . However, larger studies are needed to confirm whether wild yam in any form actually has any benefits for menopausal symptoms. Wild yam extract is sold as a dietary supplement, liquid extract, or cream. Diosgenin in wild yam has been used as raw material for synthetic progesterone, but there is no evidence that the human body can convert diosgenin into progesterone. Because wild yam has estrogenic effects, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should talk to their physicians before consumption. | Wild yam is a plant that has been promoted as natural DHEA because it contains diosgenin, which can be used in the lab to create estrogen and DHEA. There are over 600 species of wild yams. About 12 species are edible. Some people use wild yam as a source of steroids, but the body can't make steroids such as estrogen and DHEA from eating wild yam. This conversion has to be done in a lab. There might be other chemicals in wild yam that act like estrogen in the body. People most commonly use wild yam as a ""natural alterative"" to estrogen therapy for symptoms of menopause, infertility, menstrual problems, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Wild yam is possibly safe when used for up to 12 weeks. It's usually well tolerated, but taking large amounts might cause vomiting, upset stomach, and headache. When applied to the skin : Wild yam is possibly safe when applied to the skin. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if wild yam is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Wild yam might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by estrogen, don't use wild yam.","The steroid saponin diosgenin in wild yam modulates cell signaling involved in growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and oncogenesis (14). In vitro studies suggest wild yam extract protects against human breast cancer proliferation by acting as a weak phytoestrogen (3).

Quantitative analysis of freeze-dried powder (DSV) revealed approximately 63 mg inositol hexaphosphate (IP6), 2.6 mg genistein, 4.4 mg daidzein, and 15.5 mg coumestrol per serving (2). Preclinical studies performed with IP6 suggest that it slows initiation or promotion, inhibits proliferation by chelation of metalloproteins, causes G0/G1 arrest, and induces differentiation of various cancer cell lines. In vitro, genistein inhibits angiogenesis, induces DNA damage in cancer cell lines, and along with daidzein and coumestrol, inhibits the growth of human prostate cancer cells (3). Genistein and coumestrol also induced NADPH:quinone reductase, a detoxifying phase II enzyme in colonic cells, leading to possible antitumor effects (4).Shiitake mushrooms contain the polysaccharide lentinan, which may act as an immunomodulator and enhance production of IL-1, TNF, LAK, cytotoxic T lymphocytes, and cytotoxic peritoneal exudate cells.

Brugada syndrome : Lithium shouldn't be used in people who have Brugada syndrome or those who have a history of abnormal ECG readings. Also, stop taking lithium and contact your doctor if you start feeling faint or have changes in heartbeat. Dehydration : Lithium can make dehydration worse. If you are dehydrated or have low salt levels you might need to change your lithium dose. Talk to your doctor. Elderly individuals : Older age, other illnesses, and use of many medications makes it more likely that someone will have serious lithium side effects. Heart disease : Lithium may cause irregular heart rhythms. This may be a problem, especially for people who have heart disease. Kidney disease : Lithium is removed from the body by the kidneys. In people with kidney disease, the amount of lithium that is given might need to be reduced. Low sodium levels : Lithium can lower the level of salt in the blood. If you already have low levels of salt in the blood, use lithium with caution. Surgery : Lithium might interfere with surgical procedures that involve anesthesia and other drugs that affect the central nervous system.

It is also used as a diuretic, and should not be confused with Scutellaria baicalensis. In vitro studies suggest that S. barbata has antibacterial , antioxidant , antimutagenic , and anticancer properties. A number of constituents including flavonoids are thought to be responsible for these activities. Animal models also suggest antitumor activity with S. barbata across a range of cancers . However, different extraction methodologies and/or plant origins have yielded varying degrees of antitumor effects . A large long-term population study identified S. barbata among the single herbs used in TCM that may reduce risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in hepatitis B patients . Another study found association with improved overall survival . Small studies also suggest it is safe and may benefit patients with advanced breast cancer . Further research is needed to confirm these effects.",,"S. barbata possesses a range of antitumor activities via multiple intracellular targets (20), with major anticancer constituents identified as scutellarin, apigenin5-O-β-glucopyranoside, apigenin, p-coumaric acid, luteolin and 4’-hydroxywogonin (22). Polysaccharides in S. barbata demonstrate antioxidant and free radical-scavenging activity (15). Flavonoids and scutebarbatines can regulate immune function, with decreases in IL-17, IL-10, FOXP3, TGF-beta1, RORgammat, and IL-6 levels, and increases in IL-2 and IFN-gamma levels (23). Neo-clerodane diterpenoids also have demonstrated anticancer (24) and antiviral (25) activities.
Preclinical studies of S. barbata  have focused mostly on colon, lung, and liver cancer models. In human colon cancer cells, S. barbata induces apoptosis and inhibits cell proliferation and angiogenesis via Akt and p53 modulation, Bax/Bcl-2 upregulation, decreased cyclin D1/CDK4 expression, G1/S cell cycle arrest, VEGF-A inhibition, and increased p21 expression (19) (20) (26) (27). In lung tumor models, S. barbata inhibits hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha and VEGF expression (18). Polysaccharides inhibit proliferation and downregulate phospho-c-Met expression and downstream phospho-Erk/Akt signaling (18). Apoptotic effects with the alkaloid scutebarbatine A occurs via cytochrome c and caspase-3/9 upregulation, and Bcl-2 downregulation (28).
In liver tumors, S. barbata flavonoids suppressed angiogenesis via VEGF regulation, MMP2/9 inhibition, and increased TIMP1/2 expression (17) (29). Total flavonoids induced increases in DNA fragmentation and mitochondrial pathway apoptosis (30). S. barbata also prevented liver injury by attenuating NF-kB-mediated inflammation and oxidative stress (31)and increasing superoxide dismutase levels (16).
S. barbata flavonoids have produced synergistic effects in combination with cisplatin in ovarian cancer cells (32). A proprietary aqueous S. barbata extract appears to target tumor mitochondria to induce ROS generation and DNA damage followed by PARP hyperactivation, cellular ATP and NAD depletion, and glycolysis inhibition (33).",Herb,Barbat skullcap | Ban Zhi Lian | Banjiryun,Scutellaria barbata,,Scutellaria barbata,

DSI000740,Coffee,C0009237,"Coffee is a popular drink made from the roasted beans of Coffea fruits (Coffea arabica, Coffea canephora). It contains caffeine and chlorogenic acid. The caffeine in coffee works by stimulating the central nervous system (CNS), heart, and muscles. Chlorogenic acid might affect blood vessels and how the body handles blood sugar and metabolism. People most commonly drink coffee to increase mental alertness. Coffee is also used for diabetes, cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, dementia, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. Don't confuse coffee with other caffeine sources, such as green coffee, black tea, and green tea. These are not the same. | Green coffee is unroasted coffee beans from Coffea fruits (Coffea arabica, Coffea canephora). It contains more chlorogenic acid than roasted coffee. The chlorogenic acid in green coffee is thought to have health benefits. It might affect blood vessels so that blood pressure is reduced. It might also affect how the body handles blood sugar and metabolism. Green coffee also contains caffeine, but in lower amounts than regular coffee. People take green coffee for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse green coffee with other caffeine sources, including coffee, black tea, and green tea. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : Coffee is commonly consumed as a beverage. Drinking coffee in moderate amounts (about 4 cups daily) is likely safe for most people. Drinking more than 4 cups of coffee daily is possibly unsafe. Drinking large amounts might cause side effects due to the caffeine content. These side effects can range from mild to serious and include headache and irregular heartbeat. When given as an enema (rectally) : Coffee is possibly unsafe. Coffee enemas have been linked to cases of severe side effects, including death. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Drinking moderate amounts of coffee during pregnancy is possibly safe. Do not drink more than 3 cups of coffee daily. This provides about 300 mg of caffeine. Consuming more than this during pregnancy is possibly unsafe and has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage, increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other negative effects, including symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborns and a lower birth weight. Breast-feeding : Drinking 1-2 cups of coffee daily while breast-feeding is possibly safe. But drinking larger amounts is possibly unsafe. The caffeine in coffee is passed into breastmilk. It might cause irritability and increased bowel movements in nursing infants. Children : Caffeinated coffee is possibly safe in children when consumed in the normal amounts found in food and beverages. Anxiety disorders : The caffeine in coffee might make anxiety worse. Bipolar disorder : The caffeine in coffee might make symptoms of mania worse. Bleeding disorders : The caffeine in coffee might slow blood clotting and make bleeding disorders worse. Heart disease : Drinking coffee on a daily basis doesn't seem to increase the risk for serious complications from heart disease. But people who smoke and have heart disease might have an increased risk of dying from heart disease if they consume coffee daily. Diabetes : The caffeine in coffee might affect blood sugar. Use coffee with caution if you have diabetes. Diarrhea : The caffeine in coffee, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea. Seizures : Coffee contains caffeine. People with epilepsy should avoid using caffeine in high doses. Low doses of caffeine should be used cautiously. Glaucoma : Drinking caffeinated coffee increases pressure inside the eye. The increase starts within 30 minutes and lasts for at least 90 minutes. If you have glaucoma, drink coffee with caution. High blood pressure : Drinking caffeinated coffee might increase blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. But this doesn't seem to occur in people who drink caffeinated products regularly. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) : Coffee contains caffeine. The caffeine in coffee, especially when taken in large amounts, may worsen diarrhea and other symptoms of IBS. Loss of bladder control : Coffee contains caffeine. Caffeine can make bladder control worse by increasing frequency of urination and the urge to urinate. Smoking : People who smoke and drink coffee might have an increased risk of dying from heart disease or cancer. Thinning bones (osteoporosis) : Drinking caffeinated coffee can increase the amount of calcium that is flushed out in the urine. This might weaken bones. If you have osteoporosis, don't drink more than 3 cups of coffee daily. If you are generally healthy and get enough calcium from your food or supplements, drinking about 4 cups of coffee daily doesn't seem to increase the risk of getting osteoporosis. | When taken by mouth : Green coffee is possibly safe when used appropriately. Green coffee extracts taken in doses up to 1000 mg daily have been used safely for up to 12 weeks. A specific green coffee extract (Svetol, Naturex) has been used safely in doses up to 200 mg five times daily for up to 12 weeks. Green coffee contains caffeine, but in lower amounts than in regular coffee. One cup of green coffee contains about 25-50% of the amount of caffeine found in a one cup of regular coffee. Consuming large amounts of green coffee might cause caffeine-related side effects, including headache, anxiety, agitation, and irregular heartbeat. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if green coffee is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Abnormally high levels of homocysteine : Consuming a high dose of chlorogenic acid might increase homocysteine levels, which might be linked to conditions such as heart disease. Anxiety disorders : The caffeine in green coffee might make anxiety worse. Bleeding disorders : The caffeine in green coffee might make bleeding disorders worse. Diabetes : The caffeine in green coffee might affect the way people with diabetes process sugar. Use caffeine with caution if you have diabetes and monitor your blood sugar carefully. Diarrhea : Green coffee contains caffeine. Caffeine, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea. Epilepsy : Green coffee contains caffeine. People with epilepsy should avoid using caffeine in high doses. Low doses of caffeine should be used cautiously. Glaucoma : The caffeine in green coffee can increase pressure inside the eye, which can make glaucoma worse. High blood pressure : The caffeine in green coffee might increase blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. But this effect might be less in people who consume caffeine regularly. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) : Green coffee contains caffeine. Caffeine, especially when taken in large amounts, might worsen the diarrhea some people have with IBS.

Some have attempted to use this herb to treat rheumatoid arthritis, infections, and cancer (as part of the Hoxsey herbal tonic). However, pokeweed has not been studied extensively. A few in vitro studies suggest it has antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase inhibition properties . Pokeweed antiviral protein, an N-glycosidase ribosomal-inactivating protein isolated from the plant, demonstrated antiviral effects against encephalitis infection . Pokeweed causes significant toxicity following oral or topical administration. | Pokeweed is a plant. The berry, root, and leaves are used as medicine. Despite serious safety concerns, people use pokeweed for achy muscles and joints (rheumatism), swelling of the nose, throat, and chest, swollen and tender breasts (mastitis), skin infections, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. In foods, pokeweed berry is used as red food coloring and as a wine coloring agent. In manufacturing, pokeweed berry is used to make ink and dye.","When taken by mouth : Pokeweed is LIKELY UNSAFE . All parts of the pokeweed plant, especially the root, are poisonous. Severe poisoning has been reported from drinking tea brewed from pokeweed root and pokeweed leaves. Poisoning also has resulted from drinking pokeberry wine and eating pokeberry pancakes. Eating just 10 berries can be toxic to an adult. Green berries seem to be more poisonous than mature, red berries. Pokeweed can cause nausea, vomiting, cramping, stomach pain, diarrhea, low blood pressure, difficulty controlling urination (incontinence), thirst, and other serious side effects. When applied to the skin : Pokeweed is LIKELY UNSAFE . Don't touch pokeweed with your bare hands. Chemicals in the plant can pass through the skin and affect the blood. If you must handle pokeweed, use protective gloves. Special Precautions & Warnings: It's LIKELY UNSAFE for anyone to use pokeweed. But pokeweed is especially dangerous for people with the following conditions: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Pokeweed is LIKELY UNSAFE to take by mouth or apply to the skin. Pokeweed berry might cause the uterus to contract and cause a miscarriage. Breast-feeding women should also avoid pokeweed. Children : Pokeweed is UNSAFE for children. Even one berry can be poisonous to a child.","Pokeweed mitogens and glycosidic saponins are known toxins that possess mitogenic and irritant properties (1).

It is used as a component in traditional Chinese herbal formulas for blood circulation and to relieve pain. A purified alkaloid extract from this plant known as huperzine A has neuroprotective effects and has been developed as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease and dementia in Asia . In the US, it is available as a dietary supplement to promote cognitive function. It is also used by some cancer patients to relieve pain and neurological dysfunction due to chemotherapy. Most studies on H. serrata are based on the extract huperzine A, which selectively inhibits acetylcholinesterase . Animal studies suggest antiapoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidative properties may contribute to its protective effects in nerve agent poisoning , myasthenia gravis , hepatic reperfusion injury , and diabetes-associated cognitive decline . Clinical studies on huperzine A for Alzheimer’s disease have yielded mixed results , but a meta-analysis suggests that it may help mild to moderate cognitive dysfunction . One study found it improved cognitive function in vascular dementia patients . More well-designed studies are needed to determine safety and effectiveness. Although a US patent has been filed claiming its use for cancer pain and neuropathy , no clinical trials for these indications have been conducted. Mild adverse effects from huperzine have been reported . Because it acts as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, it can potentially interact with many drugs including other anticholinergic drugs, dopamine D2 receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, and beta adrenergic receptor antagonists .",,"Huperzine A is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, thereby raising acetylcholine levels in the basal ganglia (1). Higher levels of acetylcholine in the central nervous system are believed to be responsible for less severe cognitive impairment in Alzheimer’s disease (1). Additionally, huperzine can interfere with the pathway of beta-amyloid deposition by regulating precursor protein metabolism and impeding associated neurotoxicity (13). Huperzine also inhibits the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the cerebral cortex (14).
Huperzine diminished diabetes-associated cognitive decline in rats by enhancing glycemic control, suppressing inflammation, augmenting brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression, and limiting oxidative stress (5). In a mouse model of hepatic ischemia reperfusion injury, the antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties of huperzine contributed to hepatoprotective effects (4).",Whole plant,Chinese club moss | Huperzine; Hup A | Qian Ceng Ta | She Zu Cao | Jin Bu Huan; Shan Zhi,Huperzia serrata,,Huperzia serrata,

In foods and beverages, wild cherry is used as a flavoring agent. Some people eat the seeds as snacks. The fruit of wild cherry is eaten fresh, in jams, or used in liquors or syrups. | Winter cherry is a plant. It grows in central and southern Europe, Iran, China, and Southeast Asia. The fruit and leaves are used to make medicine. People use winter cherry for arthritis, enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH), fever, swelling, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","Wild cherry is LIKELY SAFE when consumed in amounts normally found in food. Wild cherry is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth in small amounts, short-term. But taking wild cherry long-term or in large amounts is POSSIBLY UNSAFE . Wild cherry contains chemicals that are poisonous in large amounts. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : It's LIKELY UNSAFE to use wild cherry if you are pregnant. Wild cherry contains a chemical, prunasin, which can cause birth defects. Not enough is known about the safety of using wild cherry during breast-feeding.

DSI000775,Pectin,C0030744,"Pectin is a soluble fiber rich in galactoside residues. It is present in most plants, but is concentrated in the peel and pulp of citrus fruits and apples. Pectin is used as a gelling agent in food. It is also used as a remedy for diarrhea, to lower cholesterol, or to improve satiety. Modified Citrus Pectin (MCP) is an altered form of pectin that has shorter carbohydrate chains and is claimed to be better absorbed by the body. Preclinical studies suggest inhibitory effects with pectin in colon , breast , liver , and lung cancer cell lines. Preliminary clinical data suggest that pectin is beneficial in treating diarrhea and reducing levels of toxic heavy metals . Pectin may also be helpful for hypercholesterolemia , but one study showed that source and type of pectin influences its activity . Another study also demonstrated that different types pectin are varied in their properties and may affect appetite and energy intake differently . Pectin has been promoted for reducing colon cancer risk and damage from radiation therapy, but there is insufficient scientific evidence to support these uses. In a small nonrandomized study, MCP increased the doubling time of prostate-specific antigen in patients with prostate cancer . Gastrointestinal side effects such as abdominal cramps and diarrhea have been reported with use of pectin . | Pectin is a soluble fiber (polysaccharide) found in fruits. It is used as a thickener in cooking and baking. It is also sometimes used to make medicine. Pectin binds substances in the intestines and adds bulk to the stools. It might also reduce how much cholesterol the body absorbs from foods. People use pectin for high cholesterol, prediabetes, heartburn, diarrhea, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Pectin was used for years together with kaolin (Kaopectate) to control diarrhea. But in 2003, the FDA found that evidence doesn't support the use of pectin for diarrhea. Since April 2004, pectin has not been permitted as an anti-diarrhea agent in over-the-counter (OTC) products. Kaopectate no longer contains pectin and kaolin.","When taken by mouth : Pectin is commonly consumed in food amounts. It is possibly safe when used in larger amounts for up to one year. It's usually well-tolerated. Side effects might include diarrhea, gas, and stomach cramps. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Pectin is commonly consumed in foods. It is possibly safe when taken by mouth in larger amounts. Children : Pectin is commonly consumed in foods. It is possibly safe when taken by mouth in larger amounts, short-term.

DSI000793,Echinacea,C0752270,"The genus Echinacea belongs to the family Compositae, commonly referred to as the sunflower family. Of the known species, E. purpurea, E. angustifolia, and E. pallida are commonly used in herbal medicine. Extracts derived from the root and aerial parts are widely used in Europe and the United States as nonspecific immunostimulants and to prevent or treat the common cold and influenza. However, natural products differ greatly in composition , mainly due to the use of different species, variable plant materials or extraction methods, and the addition of other components. Preclinical studies suggest immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory effects . A standardized echinacea preparation inactivated influenza viruses and may improve respiratory activity . In animal models, echinacea stimulated erythropoiesis, increased blood-oxygen transport , produced anxiolytic effects , and exhibited wound-healing properties .Clinical data indicate that echinacea is ineffective in preventing the common cold caused by rhinoviruses or in treating upper respiratory infections but positive findings were reported with higher doses . Studies of its ability to reduce incidence and duration of the common cold yielded mixed results . Other analyses do not indicate any benefits for treating colds, and weak evidence for a prophylactic benefit , but a large randomized trial found an echinacea formulation to be as effective as oseltamivir for influenza, and with fewer adverse events in the echinacea group . In a review of 17 clinical trials involving 3,363 participants, echinacea supplements were found to affect reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines that play a role in the progression of cytokine storm and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) . Echinacea was also reported useful in preventing respiratory tract infections and reducing associated antibiotic usage in children .Small studies have shown that a standardized echinacea root extract has immunomodulating activity ; an echinacea/sage spray was useful in treating acute sore throats ; and a formula containing dry root extracts of Echinacea purpurea and Echinacea angustifolia may be useful as an adjuvant therapy for decreasing relapse incidence in patients treated for genital condylomatosis and in those with cervical low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions . Data on anxiolytic effects are mixed but findings on improving or enhancing athletic performance are mixed . A topical echinacea extract was reported effective in alleviating symptoms associated with atopic eczema . Echinacea may also have anticancer potential evidenced by the cytotoxic effects exerted by an extract and a major compound, cichoric acid, in human colon cancer cells .Some studies suggest that echinacea could decrease plasma levels, affect therapeutic efficacy, or cause adverse effects with some anticancer drugs . In HIV-infected patients, co-administration with etravirine was found to be safe and well tolerated . In a large population-based study, use of echinacea was associated with a slight increase in diastolic blood pressure . There is insufficient evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of echinacea during pregnancy . | Echinacea (E. angustifolia, E. purpurea, E. pallida.) are plants related to sunflowers and ragweed. The leaf, flower, and root are used as medicine. Echinacea species are native to areas east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States. Echinacea seems to activate chemicals in the body that decrease inflammation. It might also increase the body's immune system. Echinacea is most commonly used for the common cold and other infections, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using echinacea for COVID-19.","When taken by mouth : Echinacea is likely safe for most people in the short-term. Various echinacea products have been used safely for up to 10 days. Some products, such as Echinaforce (A. Vogel Bioforce AG), have been used safely for up to 6 months. The most common side effects are stomach pain, constipation, diarrhea, heartburn, vomiting, and rash. Allergic reactions might occur in some people, especially in people who are allergic to ragweed, mums, marigolds, or daisies. When applied to the skin : Echinacea is possibly safe when used short-term. A cream (Linola Plus Cream) containing echinacea has been used safely for up to 12 weeks. Applying echinacea to the skin might cause redness, itchiness, or a rash. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Echinacea is possibly safe when taken by mouth for up to 7 days when pregnant. There isn't enough reliable information to know if using echinacea for longer than 7 days is safe. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if echinacea is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Echinacea is possibly safe when taken by mouth or applied to the skin for up to 10 days. Taking echinacea by mouth seems to be safe in most children ages 2-11 years, but rashes due to an allergic reaction can occur. There is some concern that allergic reactions to echinacea could be more severe in some children. An inherited tendency toward allergies (atopy) : People with this condition are more likely to develop an allergic reaction to echinacea. It's best to avoid exposure to echinacea if you have this condition. ""Auto-immune disorders"" such as such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a skin disorder called pemphigus vulgaris, or others : Echinacea might have an effect on the immune system that could make these conditions worse. Don't take echinacea if you have an auto-immune disorder.","Echinacea’s active constituents include cichoric and caftaric acids, polysaccharides, and alkylamides (47). Immune-modulating effects of a standardized echinacea root extract include upregulation of interleukin (IL)-2 and IL-8 and downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-6 (39). Immunemodulation by alkylamides occurs through binding to human cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2, and by inhibiting TNF-alpha (48). Alkylamides may also be responsible for anti-inflammatory effects (27). Although echinacea does not appear to have significant ergogenic or anabolizing effects, it appears to enhance the immune system and decrease oxidative damage (49).In vitro and in vivo, echinacea extracts were shown to stimulate phagocytosis, enhance mobility of leukocytes, stimulate TNF and IL-1 secretion from macrophages and lymphocytes, and improve respiratory activity (2) (3). However, their effects on innate immunity such as phagocytosis could not be confirmed, and showed only minimal effects on tumor progression, although echinacea did stimulate natural killer cell activity (50). Other studies suggest that bacterial components of echinacea are responsible for immune benefits, as total bacterial load differences and content of bacterial lipopolysaccharides within echinacea samples have correlated with NF-kappaB activation in THP-1 cells (51).In human colon cancer cells, cichoric acid decreased telomerase activity and induced apoptosis via DNA fragmentation, caspase-9 activation, poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage and beta-catenin downregulation (42). Differential effects of echinacea on intestinal and hepatic CYP3A activities may be due to systemic unavailability of locally-acting constituents that inhibit CYP3A, or rapid absorption of these constituents that limits intestinal exposure and CYP3A induction, or a systemically-formed constituent metabolite that is capable of inducing hepatic but not intestinal CYP3A (52).",Plante entière,"Coneflower; purple coneflower | Black Sampson; Sampson root | Sonnenhut | Igelkopfwurzel | American Cone Flower, Black Sampson, Black Susans, Brauneria Angustifolia, Brauneria Pallida, Brauneria Purpurea, Comb Flower, Coneflower, Echinacea Angustifolia, Echinacea Pallida, Echinacea Purpurea, Echinacea Serotine, Echinacea Speciose, Echinaceawurzel, Échinacée, Échinacée Angustifolia, Échinacée Pallida, Échinacée Pourpre, Échinacée Purpurea, Equinácea, Fleur À Hérisson, Hedgehog, Helichroa Purpurea, Igelkopfwurzel, Indian Head, Kansas Snakeroot, Narrow-Leaved Echinacea, Narrow-Leaved Purple Coneflower, Narrow-Leaved Purple Cone Flower, Pale Coneflower, Pale Flower Echinacea, Pale Purple Coneflower, Purple Coneflower, Purple Cone Flower, Purpursonnenhutkraut, Purpursonnenhutwurzel, Racine D'echininacea, Red Sunflower, Rock-Up-Hat, Roter Sonnenhut, Rudbeckia Purpurea, Rudbeckie Pourpre, Schmallblaettrige Kegelblumenwurzel, Schmallblaettriger Sonnenhut, Scurvy Root, Snakeroot, Sonnenhutwurzel.",Echinacea,Echinacea (unspecified) | Echinacea (various) | Echinacea | Echinacea (mixed),Echinacea,Echinacea

DSI000811,Magnolia officinalis,C1037682,"Magnolia officinalis is a flowering herb that has been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat anxiety, depression, stress, nervousness, and sleep-related problems. It is also used to regulate gastrointestinal motility and is found in herbal formulas such as Ma Zi Ren Wan. The bark contains the active constituents magnolol and honokiol. Preclinical studies suggest these compounds have antimicrobial , anti-inflammatory , antidiabetic , antidepressant , anxiolytic , and neuroprotective effects. They have also been evaluated for their anticancer potential. Magnolol demonstrated activity against a variety of cancers, including bladder , prostate , colorectal , breast , and lung cancers. Honokiol also showed antitumor and antiangiogenic effects in leukemia , lung , bladder , prostate , melanoma , breast , glioblastoma , neuroblastoma , and oral cancer cells lines. In murine models, honokiol enhanced low-dose docetaxel treatment against prostate cancer growth and bone metastasis , and reduced breast tumor growth biomarkers . Data in humans are limited. Preliminary clinical studies suggest benefits with magnolia for vasomotor symptoms , weight management , and oral health . However, these studies used magnolia in combination with other compounds. In patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, a magnolia extract was shown to be useful in reducing hepatic fat content .",,"In THP-1 cells, magnolol and honokiol reduced inflammatory TNF-α and IL-8 production induced by Propionibacterium acnes  (3). Other anti-inflammatory markers reduced by magnolia bark extract include IL-6 as well as MMP2 and MMP9 (4). Antihyperglycemic effects with magnolia bark extract are attributed to the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase enzyme 1B, a negative regulator of the insulin signaling pathway, which increases ERK phosphorylation and GLUt4 translocation (5). Magnolol increased both insulin-stimulated glucose transport and production of GLUT1 and GLUT4 mRNA, and GLUT4 protein (6).
A combination of honokiol and magnolol normalized biochemical abnormalities in brain 5-HT and 5-HIAA, serum corticosterone levels, and platelet adenylyl cyclase activity, a biomarker for depression in chronically stressed rodents (7). Anxiolytic effects of honokiol are attributed to its selective stimulation of GABA-A receptors or its binding to anxiety-related sites (8).
A number of anticancer mechanisms have been identified with magnolol. In human bladder cancer cells, it induced p27KIP1-mediated G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest to activate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway (11), and decreased binding of transcription factor NF-kB to DNA to inhibit MMP9 expression (12). In prostate cancer cells, magnolol affected insulin-like growth factor-1 expression and associated binding proteins (13), inhibited the EGFR/PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (16), and downregulated MMP2 and MMP9 proteins and mRNA levels (15). Antitumor activity also occurred via MMP9 inhibition through the NF-kB pathway in breast cancer cells (19) and through AMPK activation in colorectal cancer cells (18).
Antitumor and antiangiogenic properties of honokiol are attributed to NF-kB inhibition and the consequent scavenging of reactive oxygen species (24). In human endothelial cells, honokiol inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 phosphorylation (25). It also blocked VEGF-induced Rac to prevent migration of malignant endothelial cells (25), blocked signaling pathways in tumor cells with defective p53 (23), and suppressed NF-kB overactivity (24). In acute myeloid leukemia cells, honokiol inhibited STAT3 signaling via increased protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 expression (26). In glioma cells, it induced autophagy and activated a p53/cyclin D1/CDK6/CDK4/E2F1-dependent pathway to induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (34) and in prostate cancer cells, honokiol suppressed c-Myc protein expression (30).
In animal models of prostate cancer with bone metastasis, honokiol induced apoptosis via caspase-3,-8, and -9 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (37). As a potential P-glycoprotein inhibitor, constituents of magnolia bark extract may reduce multidrug resistance in cancer cells via P-gp downregulation (42) (43).",Rhizome bark,Magnolia bark extract | Magnolol | Houpu magnolia | Hou Po,Magnolia officinalis,,Magnolia officinalis,

Since 1998, folic acid has been added to cold cereals, flour, breads, pasta, bakery items, cookies, and crackers, as required by federal law. Foods that are naturally high in folate include leafy vegetables, okra, asparagus, certain fruits, beans, yeast, mushrooms, animal liver and kidney, orange juice, and tomato juice. Folic acid is also available as a supplement, and is often used in combination with other B vitamins. Folic acid is used for preventing and treating low blood levels of folate (folate deficiency) and high blood levels of homocysteine (hyperhomocysteinemia). People who are pregnant or might become pregnant take folic acid to prevent serious birth defects such as spina bifida. Folic acid is also used for many other conditions including depression, stroke, decline in memory and thinking skills, and many others.","When taken by mouth : It is likely safe for most people to take folic acid in doses of no more than 1 mg daily. Doses higher than 1 mg daily may be unsafe. These doses might cause stomach upset, nausea, diarrhea, irritability, confusion, behavior changes, skin reactions, seizures, and other side effects. Another form of folic acid, L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF), can also be found in supplements. This type of folic acid is possibly safe for most people in doses up to about 400 mcg daily. There is some concern that taking too much folic acid for a long time might cause serious side effects. Some research suggests that taking folic acid in doses of 0.8-1.2 mg daily might increase the risk for cancer or increase the risk of heart attack in people who have heart problems. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Folic acid 300-400 mcg daily is recommended during pregnancy to prevent certain birth defects. The maximum recommended amount of folic acid during pregnancy or breastfeeding is 800 mcg daily for those under 18 years of age and 1000 mcg daily for those over 18 years of age. Do not use more unless directed by a healthcare professional. Another form of folic acid, L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF), can also be found in supplements. This type of folic acid is possibly safe to take at a dose of up to 400 mcg daily when pregnant or breastfeeding. Children : It is likely safe for children to take folic acid by mouth in the recommended amounts for their age. But children should avoid taking folic acid in doses that are higher than the daily upper limits. These limits are 300 mcg for 1-3 years of age, 400 mcg for 4-8 years of age, 600 mcg for 9-13 years of age, and 800 mcg for 14-18 years of age. Another form of folic acid, L-5-methyltetrahydrofolate (L-5-MTHF), can also be found in supplements. This type of folic acid is possibly safe in children. Procedures to widen narrowed arteries (angioplasty) : Using folic acid, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 might worsen narrowed arteries. Folic acid should not be used by people recovering from this procedure. Cancer : Early research suggests that taking 0.8-1 mg of folic acid daily might increase the risk of cancer. Until more is known, people with a history of cancer should avoid high doses of folic acid. Seizure disorder : Taking folic acid supplements, especially in high doses, might make seizures worse in people with seizure disorders. Vitamin B12 deficiency : Taking folic acid supplements might improve certain lab tests in people with low vitamin B12 levels. This may make it seem like vitamin B12 deficiency is improved when it isn't.

DSI000961,Uncaria tomentosa,C0939876,"Cat’s claw is a vine native to South America, the bark of which has been used in traditional medicine to treat various conditions such as gastric and inflammatory disorders . It is marketed as a dietary supplement to support the body’s natural defenses, for digestive and joint health, and as a general health tonic. In vitro studies suggest some of the plant constituents have antiviral, antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties, and may enhance phagocytosis . Anticancer effects have also been observed , and bioassays suggest cat’s claw may increase neutrophil count . Data in humans are limited. Small studies suggest cat’s claw may be helpful for active rheumatoid arthritis and denture stomatitis . It also reduced chemotherapy adverse effects in a study of breast cancer patients , and improved quality of life in patients with advanced cancer . However preclinical data of a cat’s claw extract showed it could stimulate survival of pediatric leukemic cells . Therefore, larger studies evaluating safety and efficacy are needed. | Cat's claw is a vine that grows in the rainforest in South and Central America. The two most common species are Uncaria tomentosa and Uncaria guianensis. Cat's claw root and bark contain chemicals that might stimulate the immune system, kill cancer cells, and fight viruses. People use cat's claw for cancer, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), viral infections, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using cat's claw for COVID-19. Don't confuse cat's claw with cat's foot or devil's claw. These are different plants.","When taken by mouth : Cat's claw is possibly safe for most people when taken for up to 6 months. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if cat's claw is safe or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Taking cat's claw by mouth is possibly unsafe during pregnancy. Avoid using. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if cat's claw is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Auto-immune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), or other similar conditions : Cat's claw might cause the immune system to become more active. This could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using cat's claw without consulting with your healthcare provider. Kidney disease : There is a concern that cat's claw might injure the kidneys. Consult with your healthcare provider before using cat's claw. Parkinson disease : There is a concern that cat's claw might make tremors or movements worse in people with Parkinson disease. Consult with your healthcare provider before using cat's claw. Surgery : There is a concern that cat's claw might make bleeding control difficult during surgery. Stop taking cat's claw at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Oxindole alkaloids in cat’s claw have immunostimulating properties in vitro, increasing phagocytotic activity and synthesis of WBCs (5) and enhancing T-helper cell function (2). Inhibition of TNFα production (3) (4) has been linked to observed anti-inflammatory activities. Mitraphylline isolated from cat’s claw was also identified as possessing anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting release of IL1α, 1β, 4, 17, and TNFα (21).
In other preclinical studies, aqueous extracts enhanced DNA repair after chemically-induced damage (22). Protection against oxidative DNA damage following UVB exposure may occur via enhanced base excision repair and inherent antioxidant effects (23). The biphasic manner in which cat’s claw modulates anxiety, initially inducing and then reversing the effect after long-term administration, is attributed to the presence of alkaloids and flavonols (18).
The quinovic acid glycoside purified fraction of cat’s claw inhibited human bladder cancer cells via NF-κB modulation to induce apoptosis (20). Cat’s claw also inhibited lactate dehydrogenase-A, an enzyme highly expressed in malignant and treatment-resistant tumors with poor clinical outcomes (24). In vivo studies demonstrated antineoplastic effects against breast tumors due to modulation of oxidative stress and synergy among constituents with antioxidant properties, rather than alkaloid activity (12).",Stem bark,"Una de gato | Saventaro | Life-giving vine of Peru | Hawk's claw | Griffe du Chat, Hawk's Claw, Liane du Pérou, Life-giving Vine of Peru, Peruvian Liana, Samento, Uña de Gato, Uncaria guianensis, Uncaria tomentosa.",Uncaria tomentosa,Cat's Claw,Cat's Claw,Cat's Claw

DSI001018,Sophora flavescens,C1014921,"Sophora flavescens is a deciduous shrub related to peas. The root known as “Kushen” which means “bitter root” in Chinese, has been used in Traditional Medicine for two thousand years to treat a variety of conditions including diarrhea, jaundice, and skin rashes, and to kill parasites . Although this herb is generally not consumed as a dietary supplement in the West, recent lab studies indicate that it has antitumor properties and patients are using it as a natural cancer treatment. Matrine, an alkaloid present in Sophora flavescens, demonstrated antitumor effects against liver , breast , pancreatic , myeloma and gastric cancer cell lines. Other flavonoids such as kuraninone and sophoraflavonone are also thought to be biologically active and may have vasodilatory and antiviral effects , and benefit patients with ulcerative colitis . Adjunctive use of formulas containing Kushen may improve effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer . Sophora flavescens acts as a phytoestrogen and therefore, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should avoid this product.",,"In animal models, the antiviral properties of sophoridine, an alkaloid constituent, appear to be mediated via upregulation of IL-10 and IFN-gamma cytokines (11). S. flavescens flavonoids may promote vasodilation by inhibiting Ca2+ influx through a voltage-gated channel (12). The flavonoids sophoraflavonone G and kurarinone may be responsible for antioxidant effects, which are mediated through free-radical scavenging (4). Anti-inflammatory effects of Sophoraflavonone G are attributed to inhibition of prostaglandin E2 formation via COX-2 downregulation (13). (2S)-2’-Methoxykurarinone isolated from S. flavescens root inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption via receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and c-Fos-NFATc1 signaling pathways (29).
Most reported antineoplastic effects of S.flavescens are due to the proapoptotic activity of matrine, the main alkaloid constituent. In human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, matrine inhibits matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) by downregulating the NF-kappa B pathway (18). It also demonstrates antiangiogenic effects by inhibiting VEGF and VEGFR-2 (19). Matrine triggers the mitochondrial pathway, in which cytochrome C release induces caspase-9 and -3 activation and subsequently induces apoptosis (2) (3) (10) (21).",Root,Ku Shen Gen | Bitter root | Yellow sophora root,Sophora flavescens,Sophora flavescens | Shrubby Sophora,Sophora flavescens,

DSI001097,"Benzo(g)-1,3-benzodioxolo(5,6-a)quinolizinium, 5,6-dihydro-9,10-dimethoxy-",C0005117,"Berberine is an alkaloid constituent active in a number of plant species including barberry (Berberis vulgaris), Chinese goldthread (Coptis chinensis), goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), tree turmeric (Berberis aristata), and Oregon grape (Berberis aquifolium) . It has a deep yellow color with fluorescent properties and has long been used as a dye. Berberine is commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Ayurveda, and other medicinal traditions to treat infections, diarrhea, and inflammatory disorders. In China, it is frequently used for the adjuvant treatment of type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension . As a supplement, it is marketed to support already normal glucose and lipid metabolism. Preclinical studies suggest antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and atheroprotective properties , as well as potential antitumor effects . Preliminary data suggest some benefit for patients with irritable bowel syndrome and to improve metabolic and endocrine markers in women with polycystic ovary syndrome . In patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis , berberine reduced hepatic fat and improved metabolic and lipid profiles. Adjunctive use also reduced the risk of glycolipid metabolic disturbances in patients with schizophrenia and reduced inflammatory markers in patients with acute coronary syndrome following percutaneous coronary intervention . Meta-analyses evaluating trials of berberine for dyslipidemia suggest improved lipid profiles, although many studies were heterogeneous, of low quality, or had a high risk of bias , and a review indicates the magnitude of effect to be small . Other meta-analyses of berberine for hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or diabetes also determined that most studies are of limited quality . One analysis that showed benefit in type 2 diabetic patients suggests it may be more helpful in younger patients or with short-term treatment , while another associated berberine with anthropometric improvements that may indirectly affect metabolic disease symptoms . Data also indicate that berberine and probiotics have a synergistic hyperlipidemic effect in type-2 diabetic patients . Berberine was also found effective in reducing the risk of recurrence of colorectal adenoma, and may be useful as a chemopreventive following polypectom . In addition, berberine has been studied in combination with other supplements. Data suggest a nutraceutical combination including berberine, red yeast rice , policosanol, astaxanthin, folic acid, and CoQ10 may lower cholesterol in HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy . It also improved lipid profiles in statin-intolerant patients with coronary heart disease . In hypercholesterolemic patients with moderate CVD risk, another nutraceutical containing berberine and red yeast rice yielded lower LDL and triglycerides with better tolerance than with ezetimibe, but did not affect HDL . However oral bioavailability of berberine is considered poor , and monacolin K in red yeast rice has statin-like side effects, prompting the continued search for other enhanced-bioavailability berberine/nutraceutical combinations . More generally, the consensus of an international lipid expert panel is that evidence for use of either a single or combination lipid-lowering nutraceutical is limited and variable, but that berberine may have benefit for prevention, particularly in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia who are statin-intolerant or have metabolic syndrome . In healthy subjects, berberine did not increase side effects when used in combination with simvastatin or fenofibrate . Additional well-designed trials that test safety and efficacy of berberine both singly and in combination with other interventions are warranted. | Berberine is a chemical found in some plants like European barberry, goldenseal, goldthread, Oregon grape, phellodendron, and tree turmeric. Berberine is a bitter-tasting and yellow-colored chemical. It might help strengthen the heartbeat, which could benefit people with certain heart conditions. It might also kill bacteria, help regulate how the body uses sugar in the blood, and help reduce swelling. People most commonly use berberine for diabetes, high levels of cholesterol or other fats in the blood, and high blood pressure. It is also used for burns, canker sores, liver disease, and many other conditions but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Berberine is possibly safe for most adults. It's been used safely in doses up to 1.5 grams daily for 6 months. Common side effects include diarrhea, constipation, gas, and upset stomach. When applied to the skin : Berberine is possibly safe for most adults when used short-term. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : It's likely unsafe to take berberine by mouth if you are pregnant. Berberine can cross the placenta and might cause harm to the fetus. Kernicterus, a type of brain damage, has developed in newborn infants exposed to berberine. Breast-feeding : It's likely unsafe to take berberine if you are breast-feeding. Berberine can be transferred to the infant through breast milk, and it might cause harm. Children : It's likely unsafe to give berberine to newborns. It can cause kernicterus, a rare type of brain damage that can occur in newborns who have severe jaundice. There isn't enough reliable information to know if berberine is safe in older children. High bilirubin levels in the blood in infants : Bilirubin is a chemical that is produced when old red blood cells break down. It is normally removed by the liver. Berberine may keep the liver from removing bilirubin fast enough. This can cause brain problems, especially in infants with high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Avoid using.","Preclinical studies suggest atheroprotective effects with berberine are related to increased expression of hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor, reduced LDLR modulator proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), and improvements in endothelial dysfunction (3). In animal models, berberine exhibited statin-like effects by reducing LDL and total cholesterol levels as well as aortic lesions, and improved glucose tolerance while reducing glucose levels, weight gain, and adipose tissue (3). Other models indicate berberine may also alter hepatic metabolism-related gene expression as it is favorably located in the liver (9).
In humans, cardioprotective effects are partly attributed to reduced myocardial autophagy and apoptosis via the AMPK/mTOR pathway (26). In patients with acute coronary syndrome, berberine adjunctive to standard care reduced inflammatory markers including matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 (10). Improvements in fatty liver disease are facilitated by decreased levels of circulating ceramides (27).",Berberine hydrochloride | Berberis aristata - Whole plant,"Berberine alkaloid | Berberine HCl | Daruharidra | Alcaloïde de Berbérine, Berberina, Berbérine, Berberine Alkaloid, Berberine Complex, Berberine Sulfate, Sulfate de Berbérine, Umbellatine.","5,6-Dihydro-9,10-dimethoxybenzo(g)-1,3-benzodioxolo(5,6-a)quinolizinium chloride | 5,6-Dihydro-9,10-dimethoxybenzo(g)-1,3-benzodioxolo(5,6-a)quinolizinium sulfate",Berberine,Berberine,Berberine

DSI001172,Insulin,C1533581,"Insulin potentiation therapy (IPT) is an alternative cancer therapy that uses insulin to potentiate the effects of chemotherapy and other medications. This therapy was developed in Mexico by Dr. Donato Perez Garcia in the 1930s and has been used together with other unconventional therapies . Advocates of IPT believe that cancer cells consume more sugar than healthy cells and are therefore more sensitive to insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) . Insulin is also believed to increase the permeability of cell membranes, increasing the intracellular concentration and cytotoxic effect of anticancer drugs . According to the theory underlying this therapy, if cancer cells can be activated by exogenous insulin, a reduced dose (up to one-tenth the normal dose) of a chemotherapy drug can provide the same cytotoxic effects with less severe adverse reactions. The pharmacokinetic profiles on concurrent use of insulin and chemotherapy drugs are lacking and it is unclear whether insulin also potentiates toxic effects of chemotherapy on healthy cells. Exploratory studies suggest some benefit with a combination of chemotherapy and IPT , but well-designed clinical trials have not been conducted. Many of the medications used in IPT, such as insulin and other chemotherapy drugs, are FDA-approved but IPT clinics administer them “off-label.” Furthermore, some clinics that administer IPT are not operated or staffed by oncologists. Side effects of IPT include hypoglycemic reaction. A systematic review of 21 studies showed a correlation between circulating levels of IGF-I, IGFBP3 (IGF-binding protein) and an increased risk of common cancers .",,"IPT is a treatment strategy that seeks to utilize the physiological activities of insulin. It is based on the theory that insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) play an important role in the cell cycle. IGF has been shown to affect proliferation, adhesion, and migration of normal as well as cancerous cells (2) and certain IGF receptors are overexpressed in many forms of cancer. Therefore, cancer cells may be selectively more sensitive than normal cells to IGF (1) (7).
IGF receptors can be activated by exogenous insulin. Insulin is also believed to increase the permeability of cell membranes, leading to the increased intracellular concentrations and cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs.
Proponents argue that insulin synergistically enhances cancer drug efficacy so that a reduced dose can be used with similar cytotoxic effects (5) (6), but the role of IGF receptors in cancer treatment is likely more complex.",Insulin,IPT,Insulin,Insulina,Insulin Potentiation Therapy,

The active component, an alkaloid called yohimbine, has been tested in clinical studies to treat sexual dysfunction . It was prescribed as an oral treatment for erectile dysfunction prior to the approval of PDE5 inhibitors, but there is a lack of direct evidence on its efficacy and safety . Data are also limited on the use of yohimbine for PTSD , orthostatic hypotension , athletic performance , and xerostomia . It is important to note that yohimbe products are among supplements with the largest number of documented contraindications , toxic effects , and severe events requiring hospitalization . | Yohimbe (Pausinystalia yohimbe) is an evergreen tree native to Africa. Its bark contains the chemical yohimbine, traditionally used as an aphrodisiac. The yohimbine in yohimbe can increase blood flow and nerve impulses to the penis or vagina. It can also help counteract the sexual side effects of certain medications used for depression. People most commonly use yohimbe for sexual problems. It is also used to boost mood, for athletic performance, and other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Yohimbe is possibly unsafe. A chemical in yohimbe, called yohimbine, has been linked to severe side effects including irregular heartbeat, heart attack, and others. It can be safely used short-term when monitored by a healthcare provider. But it shouldn't be used without medical supervision. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Yohimbe is likely unsafe. Yohimbe might affect the uterus and put pregnancy in danger. It might also poison the unborn child. Don't take yohimbe if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Anxiety : Yohimbe might make anxiety worse in people with panic disorder. Don't use yohimbe if you have anxiety. Prostate problems : Yohimbe might make the symptoms of BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) worse. Use yohimbe with caution if you have BPH. Heart disease : Yohimbe can seriously harm the heart.

People who take yohimbe should stop at least 2 weeks before surgery.","Effects on erectile dysfunction may result from inhibition of presynaptic-α1-adrenoceptor activity in cavernous smooth muscle cells and impact on NO and cGMP formation involving endothelium and endothelial NO synthase activity, which is testosterone-dependent (6) (17). Yohimbe also has dilatory effect on genital blood vessels, enhanced genital tissue sensation, and increased reflex excitability in the sacral region (4).
The active constituents are indole alkaloids including yohimbine (16), which possesses endothelin-like actions and affects NO production in renal circulation (18), and exerts anxiogenic effects through the noradrenergic pathway, which activates the HPA stress axis (19). As an α2-adrenoreceptor antagonist, yohimbine enhances norepinephrine release, increases parasympathomimetic activity, and reduces sympathetic activity (15) (20) (21). Blocking of α2-adrenoreceptors also results in increased blood supply to cavernous body tissue and increased plasma levels of noradrenaline by increasing its release from the sympathetic nervous system (4) (21).

The leaves and stems are used in traditional medicine for symptoms associated with inflammation and infection. Graviola is also available as a dietary supplement and widely promoted as an alternative treatment for cancer, although clinical evidence is lacking. In some Caribbean countries, it is one of the common herbal remedies used among prostate, breast, and colorectal cancer patients . Perceived health benefits of graviola are attributed to its antioxidant properties . In animal models, graviola extracts showed anti-inflammatory , analgesic , antidiabetic , antiulcer , and antiviral effects. The leaf extracts also have antimicrobial activities . Lab studies have also evaluated extracts from the graviola leaf, fruit, and seed for their anticancer effects. Some of these studies suggest activity against breast , lung , colon , prostate , pancreatic , liver , and skin cancer cell lines, but human studies are lacking. In addition, it is unclear whether the neurotoxicity identified in preclinical studies may translate to humans, as one systematic review suggests a favorable profile with graviola leaf extract , so more studies are needed to determine safety and efficacy. | Graviola (Annona muricata) is a small tree native to tropical regions.

People use graviola for human papilloma virus (HPV), bacterial infections, cancer, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. It also might be unsafe.",When taken by mouth : Graviola is possibly unsafe. Taking larger amounts of the fruit or regularly drinking tea made from the leaves has been linked to movement disorders similar to Parkinson disease. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Do not use graviola. It is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth. Parkinson disease : Graviola might make the symptoms of Parkinson disease worse.,"Annonaceous acetogenins isolated from the leaves, bark, and twigs are among the active constituents (35). Graviola-induced cell death inhibited by glucose supplementation suggests energy depletion (20). Graviola has also been shown to stimulate serotonin receptors (24). Cell-stimulating behaviors may occur either by increased mitochondrial turnover or by preparation to leave the G1 phase, possibly through a promitotic stimulus present within the extract which acts like a growth factor (28).
In animal models, antidiabetic effects are due to antioxidant, hypolipidemic, and protective effects in pancreatic beta-cells, which improves glucose metabolism (7). Antiulcer effects may occur via increased nitric oxide and prostaglandin E2 activities (8). Anti-inflammatory and analgesic actions with a fruit extract occurred via COX-1/2 inhibition and the blocking of opioid receptors (5).
Graviola extracts were effective against adriamycin-resistant human mammary adenocarcinoma by blocking ATP access and inhibiting plasma membrane glycoprotein (29). Inhibition of HIF-1α, NF-κB, glucose transporters, and glycolytic enzymes also decreased glucose uptake and ATP production in pancreatic cancer cells (15). In breast cancer cells, EGFR expression was downregulated (16) and free-radical scavenging occurred (30). In colon and in lung cancer cell lines, G1 cell-cycle arrest occurred by upregulating Bax and downregulating Bcl-2 proteins (12) (13).
In vitro, graviola alkaloids caused movement disorders and myeloneuropathy with symptoms mimicking Parkinson’s disease (20) (21).

It is the most studied of all I3C metabolites and is thought to be superior to IC3 as a chemoprotective against breast and prostate cancers .Preclinical studies suggest DIM has anti-inflammatory , antiproliferative and chemopreventive effects and may also help increase bone mass .Limited human data indicate daily supplementation with DIM may benefit patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer by inhibiting the androgen receptor , but studies are mixed on whether it exerts positive effects in women with cervical cell abnormalities . Small studies suggest DIM may lead to changes in estrogen metabolism in premenopausal , and postmenopausal women with a history of early stage breast cancer . In an RCT of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer patients taking tamoxifen, daily DIM promoted an increase in the metabolite ratio of 2-hydroxyestrone (2-OHE1, anti-tumorigenic) to 16α-hydroxyestrone (16α-OHE1, pro-tumorigenic) . However, this increase was coupled with a reduction in metabolites from tamoxifen. More research is needed to elucidate the pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy of tamoxifen when taken with DIM. | Diindolylmethane is made in the body from a chemical called indole-3-carbinol, which is found in cruciferous vegetables such as cauliflower and broccoli. Diindolylmethane might act like estrogen in the body, but might also block estrogen effects. It appears to help destroy cancer cells and reduce swelling. People commonly use diindolylmethane for breast cancer, prostate cancer, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Diindolylmethane is commonly consumed in foods. A typical diet supplies 2-24 mg of diindolylmethane daily. It is possibly safe for most people when taken in doses up to 150 mg daily for up to 1 year. The most common side effects include headache, nausea, vomiting, gas, and diarrhea. Taking larger doses of diindolylmethane is possibly unsafe. Taking 600 mg of diindolylmethane daily might lower sodium levels in some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Diindolylmethane is commonly consumed in foods.

Elderberry flowers and fruit are incorporated in remedies to reduce cold and flu symptoms, for inflammation and respiratory diseases , and to relieve constipation . The berries are a rich source of anthocyanins and other phenolics and nutrients . Several species of Sambucus produce elderberries with similar chemical compositions including American Elder (Sambucus canadensis) and Blue Elder (Sambucus caerulea) , but European Elder (Sambucus nigra) is the type most studied and used in supplements. In vitro studies demonstrate that elderberries possess antiviral , antibacterial , antidiabetic , immunomodulatory , antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and chemopreventive properties , although inhibition of cancer cell growth was shown to be weak . Flavonoids and proanthocyanidins were shown to block HIV1 infection, and may have additive effects with existing AIDS drugs such as enfuvirtide . Elderberry also conferred protective effects against oxidative stressors in endothelial cells . However, it did not demonstrate vasoprotective effects , and randomized trials found it ineffective in improving cardiovascular disease biomarkers or for improving cholesterol levels . Small studies found elderberry to be safe and effective in a preparation for chronic constipation and in reducing episodes of tonsillitis in children . It may also help reduce symptoms of influenza , but larger studies are needed to confirm these findings . Unsubstantiated claims that elderberry prevents or treats various diseases including AIDS, diabetes, flu and COVID-19 have been halted by the FDA. This is particularly important as patients may forego or avoid legitimate treatments. | Elderberry (Sambucus nigra) is the dark purple berry from the European elder tree. It has a long history of use for cold and flu. Elderberry is a popular ingredient in supplements. It might affect the immune system, and also seems to have activity against viruses, including the flu. Elderberry is commonly used for the common cold, flu, high cholesterol, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using elderberry for COVID-19. Don't confuse elderberry with American Elder, Elderflower, or Dwarf Elder.

The fruits are consumed as food and also used in traditional medicine to treat skin infections, wounds, and diarrhea. Mangosteen juice is marketed as a health drink and the pericarp, or fruit hull, is used in dietary supplements for its antioxidant activity. Preliminary data show that xanthones, bioactive compounds in mangosteen, exhibit antibacterial , antifungal , anti-inflammatory , antiatherosclerotic , anti-asthmatic , antiangiogenic , cytotoxic , aromatase-inhibitory , and anticancer properties. They may also provide protection against doxorubicin-induced neurotoxicity and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity . Small studies suggest benefits of mangosteen-containing products as adjuncts in periodontal treatment , controlling halitosis , and in the treatment of chronic periodontitis . Mangosteen extracts were also found useful for weight management and for improving insulin sensitivity , but ineffective in alleviating exercise-induced fatigue or for treating schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder . Topical use of a mangosteen extract improved mild-moderate acne . Confirmatory studies are needed. | Mangosteen (Garcinia mangostana) is a plant that grows in Southeast Asia. The fruit is dark purple or red. The fruit pulp is slightly acidic and sweet. Mangosteen contains chemicals that might act as antioxidants and fight infections. People use mangosteen for serious gum infections, obesity, muscle strength, diarrhea, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. Don't confuse mangosteen with garcinia. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : Mangosteen is possibly safe when taken for up to 12 weeks. It might cause constipation, bloating, nausea, vomiting, and tiredness. When applied to the gums : Mangosteen gel is possibly safe. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if mangosteen is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Bleeding disorders : Mangosteen might slow blood clotting. Taking mangosteen might increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding disorders. Surgery : Mangosteen might slow blood clotting. Taking mangosteen might increase the risk of bleeding during or after surgery. Stop taking mangosteen 2 weeks before surgery.","Many compounds isolated from mangosteen fruit and pericarp have been evaluated in lab studies. Xanthones alpha- and beta-mangostins, and garcinone B exhibit strong inhibitory effects against Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (3), as well as aromatase-inhibitor activity (14). Alpha- and gamma-mangostins act as histamine and serotonin receptor blockers (8) and inhibit HIV-1 protease (9). In animal models, they reduced major features of allergic asthma including airway inflammatory cell recruitment and hyperresponsiveness, increased Th2 cytokine levels, and attenuated increases in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity, phosphorylation of Akt, and NF-kappaB (26). The ability of alpha-mangostin to inhibit fatty acid synthase may occur via stronger action on the ketoacyl synthase domain and weaker effects on the acetyl/malonyl transferase domain (22). It also reduced prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting COX-1 and -2 enzyme activities (5), and prevented oxidative damage of LDL by functioning as a free-radical scavenger (7). The compound isogarcinol isolated from mangosteen induces anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects in animal models (30) (31). Mangosteen extract may have antiobesity effects by increasing AMP-activated protein kinase and Sirtuin 1 activities in the liver (42).
Chemopreventive properties of mangosteen xanthones against specific human cancer cell lines have also been demonstrated, including: alpha-mangostin in leukemia (1) (6) (32), breast (33) (34), gastric (35), and pancreatic cancer cells (36) (37); gartanin in urinary bladder cancer (38); and gamma-mangostin (39) and garcinone E (10) in liver cancer cells. Extracts from the pericarp of mangosteen also exhibit antioxidant (13), antiproliferative, and apoptotic effects (11).
The preventive effect of alpha-mangostin on cisplatin-induced apoptotic death is associated with the inhibition of p53 expression and generation of reactive oxygen species (23). Alpha-mangostin inhibited growth of leukemia HL60 cells by inducing caspase-3-dependent apoptosis (1) (6). It reduced matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 and -9 expression, increased E-cadherin expression, and suppressed the ERK signaling pathway in pancreatic cancer cell lines (36). In chronic myeloid leukemia cells, it induced autophagy via increased expression of the autophagosome marker LC-3II and accumulation of autophagic vacuoles, in addition to antiproliferative and apoptotic effects (32). Another study also attributes the antitumor activity of alpha-mangostin to autophagy and not endoplasmic reticulum stress induction (24).

DSI001336,Lobelia,C1095900,"Derived from the aerial parts of the plant, patients use lobelia for smoking cessation and to treat asthma and depression. Piperidine alkaloids are thought responsible for lobelia’s activity. In vitro and animal studies show that lobeline, a major constituent, crosses the blood-brain barrier, has activity similar to that of nicotine, and stimulates the release of dopamine and norepinephrine . At low doses lobelia has stimulant effects, but higher doses result in CNS depression . Murine studies suggest lobeline may produce anticonvulsant , neuroprotective , and antidepressive effects . Other preclinical studies suggest it may improve withdrawal-induced depression , enhance the effects of other antidepressants , and reduce alcohol consumption . In other experiments, lobeline improved acute lung injury and reversed multidrug resistance of tumor cells to doxorubicin . Limited studies have been conducted in humans. In a small proof-of-concept study in adults with ADHD, lobeline had modest improvements in working memory but not in attention . Clinical studies of lobelia do not support its use for smoking cessation . | Lobelia is a plant that grows in Canada and the northern U.S. The above ground parts are used to make medicine. Lobelia is used for asthma, bronchitis, whooping cough, quitting smoking, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Lobelia is also likely unsafe when taken by mouth.","When taken by mouth : Lobelia is LIKELY UNSAFE for most people. Side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, dizziness, and tremors. Large doses of lobelia may cause serious toxic effects including sweating, convulsions, fast heartbeat, very low blood pressure, coma, and possibly death. Taking 0.6-1 gram of the leaf is said to be toxic, and 4 grams may be fatal. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if lobelia is safe or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: It's LIKELY UNSAFE for anyone to take lobelia by mouth. But lobelia is especially dangerous for people with the following conditions: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Taking lobelia is LIKELY UNSAFE . It can cause serious vomiting. Don't take lobelia if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Stomach or intestinal problems including ulcers, Crohn disease, inflammatory bowel disease, infections, and others : Lobelia can irritate the GI tract, which might make these conditions worse. Heart disease : Lobelia can affect the heart, especially when taken in large doses. Do not take lobelia if you have heart disease.","Lobelia has central stimulant activity, dilates bronchioles, and increases respiration rate at low doses, but higher doses cause CNS and respiratory depression (10). Lobeline, a major alkaloid constituent, is a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ligand (24).
In vitro, lobeline redistributes dopamine pools in presynaptic vesicles and antagonizes their release following amphetamine stimulation. Lobeline can have both antagonistic and synergistic effects when combined with nicotine and does not induce receptor upregulation as seen with nicotine (10).
In rodent models, lobeline increases dopamine release from striatal synaptosomes, increases norepinephrine release from the hippocampus (5), and binds extensively to nicotinic receptors both centrally and peripherally (4). Other animal studies suggest that beta-amyrin palmitate stimulates release of norepinephrine in the brain, possibly leading to an antidepressant effect (1). Murine studies suggest attenuation of withdrawal-induced depressive behavior may occur by targeting brain nAChRs, serotonergic and noradrenergic neurotransmissions, and/or hippocampal cell proliferation (22) (23).
Intravenous administration of approximately 12 mcg/kg lobeline to healthy human subjects resulted in cough, apnea, prolonged inspiration and expiratory pause, the feeling of choking, and pressure in the throat and chest (9).",Lobelia inflata - herb top | Plante entière,"Lobella | Asthma weed | Indian tobacco | Gagroot | Pukeweed | Vomit weed | Asthma Weed, Bladderpod, Emetic Herb, Gagroot, Herbe à Asthme, Indian Tobacco, Lobelia inflata, Lobélie, Lobélie Brûlante, Lobélie Enflée, Lobélie Gonflée, Pukeweed, Tabac Indien, Vomit Wort, Wild Tobacco.",Lobelia Inflata | Lobelia syphilitica,Lobelia,Lobelia,Lobelia

DSI001418,Algal Oil,C3538243,"Algal oil is an oil from marine algae that is rich in certain omega-3 fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Certain algae species are grown in agriculture specifically to produce algal oil. It can be made from a variety of species, including Crypthecodinium, Nannochloropsis, Schizochytrium, Prototheca, and Ulkenia. The fatty acids in the oil might reduce swelling and help with brain function. People use algal oil for preventing preterm birth. It is also used for improving thinking skills, physical performance, autism, ADHD, depression, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse algal oil with specific types of algae, such as blue-green algae, brown algae, chlorella, or laminaria. Also, don't confuse algal oil with DHA or EPA from other sources such as fish oil, krill oil, or cod liver oil. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : Algal oil rich in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is likely safe. It's been used safely for up to 4 years. Algal oil rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) is possibly safe. It's been used safely for up to 3 months. Most side effects are mild and might include fishy burps and stomach symptoms. Taking high doses of algal oil providing more than 3 grams of DHA and EPA daily is possibly unsafe. High doses might slow blood clotting and increase the chance of bleeding. The FDA recommends limiting  intake of DHA and EPA to no more than 3 grams daily, with no more than 2 grams daily from a dietary supplement. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Algal oil that is rich in DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid, is likely safe when taken by mouth when pregnant or breast-feeding. Algal oil is included in some prenatal vitamins and infant formulas as a source of DHA. If it is taken while pregnant or breast-feeding, DHA levels in the breast milk increase. Most experts recommended consuming 300 mg of DHA daily while pregnant and breast-feeding. This can be met by eating 8-12 ounces of seafood weekly during pregnancy, and 4-8 ounces weekly while breast-feeding. Those who are nutrient deficient or who do not eat fish may need to take a supplement such as algal oil. There isn't enough reliable information to know if algal oil rich in EPA, another type of omega-3 fatty acid, is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Infants and children : Algal oil rich in DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid, is likely safe for infants and children. Algal oil is included as a source of DHA in some infant formula. It is generally recognized as safe for this use. Algal oil has also been used safely for up to 4 years in children 7 years and older in daily doses that provide 30 mg/kg of DHA. There isn't enough reliable information to know if algal oil rich in EPA, another type of omega-3 fatty acid, is safe to use in infants and children. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Aspirin-sensitivity : Some algal oil contains DHA. DHA might affect your breathing if you are sensitive to aspirin. Bleeding conditions : Some algal oil contains the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA. DHA alone does not seem to affect blood clotting. But taking algal oil in doses providing more than 3 grams daily of EPA and DHA might increase the risk of bleeding. Difficulty breathing in preterm infants : Some algal oil contains DHA. DHA might worsen breathing in preterm infants who already have difficulty breathing. Diabetes : Some algal oil contains DHA. DHA might increase pre-meal blood sugar in people with type 2 diabetes. Low blood pressure : Some algal oil contains DHA. DHA can lower blood pressure.

DSI001441,5-htp,C0000578,"5-HTP or L-5-Hydroxytryptophan is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin and melatonin. It is formed by hydroxylation of the amino acid L-tryptophan. 5-HTP is marketed as a dietary supplement for sleep, to improve mood and well-being, and to suppress appetite. Seeds from the African shrub Griffonia simplicifolia are a major source for these supplements due to their high 5-HTP content . In animal models, anxiolytic and antidyskinetic effects have been demonstrated . 5-HTP has also been shown to restore serotonin levels or, at excessive levels, to induce serotonin syndrome . In humans, most research on 5-HTP involves small trials with mixed results. A few studies suggest 5-HTP may reduce anxiety or depression , but not treatment-resistant depression . Evidence for its use in PTSD prevention is also lacking . Other studies suggest antidepressant effects comparable with fluoxetine , and potential benefit as part of augmentation therapy for drug-resistant depression . 5-HTP has also been evaluated for obesity. Preliminary findings suggest it may help decrease food intake and increase weight loss and early satiety . More recently, a sublingual 5-HTP spray increased appetite control in overweight women . Other preliminary studies suggest benefit for patients with fibromyalgia , but not for postmenopausal hot flashes or tardive dyskinesia . 5-HTP does not appear to reduce chronic tension headaches, although a decrease in analgesic use was noted . It was also ineffective as prophylaxis for childhood migraine , but may improve pediatric sleep terrors . Larger well-designed studies are needed to determine the populations and conditions for which 5-HTP supplementation may be useful, and to determine safety, particularly in conjunction with other serotonergic medications including antidepressants. | 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) can be converted to serotonin in the body. It is often used for depression. It has less evidence for insomnia and anxiety. 5-HTP is a chemical byproduct of the protein building block L-tryptophan. It is produced commercially from the seeds of an African plant known as Griffonia simplicifolia. 5-HTP works in the brain and central nervous system by increasing the production of the chemical serotonin. Serotonin can affect sleep, appetite, temperature, sexual behavior, and pain sensation. Since 5-HTP increases serotonin levels, it is used for conditions in which serotonin is believed to play an important role. These include depression, anxiety, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.","When taken by mouth : It is possibly safe to take 5-HTP in doses of up to 400 mg daily for up to one year. The most common side effects include heartburn, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, sexual problems, and muscle problems. Large doses of 5-HTP, such as 6-10 grams daily, are possibly unsafe. These doses have been linked to severe stomach problems and muscle spasms. Some people who have taken 5-HTP have developed a serious health condition called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS). Some people think EMS might be caused by an accidental contaminant in some 5-HTP products. But there's not enough scientific evidence to know if EMS is caused by 5-HTP, a contaminant, or some other factor. Until more is known, 5-HTP should be used cautiously. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if 5-HTP is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : It is possibly safe for children to take 5-HTP by mouth at appropriate doses. In children under 12 years of age, 5-HTP seems to be safe at a dose of up to 5 mg/kg daily for up to 3 years. Surgery : 5-HTP can affect a brain chemical called serotonin. Some drugs administered during surgery can also affect serotonin. Taking 5-HTP before surgery might cause too much serotonin in the brain and can result in serious side effects including heart problems, shivering, and anxiety. Tell patients to stop taking 5-HTP at least 2 weeks before surgery.","5-HTP crosses the blood-brain barrier and increases serotonin synthesis (25). The advantage of 5-HTP over L-tryptophan is its ability to bypass the rate-limiting step that tryptophan must undergo via the enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase to convert to 5-HTP. In addition, this enzyme can be inhibited by various factors including B6 or magnesium deficiencies, stress, or insulin resistance, and make tryptophan unavailable for serotonin production (2).
In a series of preclinical experiments, 5-HTP was metabolized by a wide variety of gut bacteria and converted to 5-hydroxyindole, which can accelerate GI motility, but this conversion depends upon microbial composition and pH (39).
Relaxation and anxiolytic properties of 5-HTP are attributed to its ability to elevate CNS serotonin levels (2). 5-HTP was shown to augment neuroendocrine response to an SSRI via increased presynaptic 5HT availability, thus enhancing 5HT release into the synapse (26). It was also proposed to potentially reduce hot flashes in menopausal women with breast cancer or with risk of breast cancer by enhancing serotonin levels (27) , but a clinical study in postmenopausal women found it ineffective (20) .
5-HTP can also increase levels of melatonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine (28) (29), compounds involved in mood and sleep regulation and whose mechanistic pathways may also be stimulated (2). As abnormalities in serotonin and epinephrine pathways have been suspected in fibromyalgia and other chronic diseases (5) (30), this may help to explain preliminary benefits seen with 5-HTP supplementation in other disease states.

The fruit of the capsicum plant contains a chemical called capsaicin. Capsaicin is what seems to help reduce pain and swelling. A particular form of capsicum causes intense eye pain and other unpleasant effects when it comes in contact with the face. This form is used in self-defense pepper sprays. Capsicum is commonly used for nerve pain and other painful conditions. It is also used for many other purposes, including digestion problems, conditions of the heart and blood vessels, and many others, but there is no good scientific evidence for many of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Capsicum is likely safe when consumed in amounts typically found in food. Capsaicin, the active chemical in capsicum, is possibly safe when used short-term. Side effects can include stomach irritation, sweating, and runny nose. Capsicum is possibly unsafe to take in large doses or for long periods of time. When applied to the skin : Lotions and creams that contain capsicum extract are likely safe for most adults. Capsaicin is approved by the FDA as an over-the-counter medication. Side effects can include skin irritation and itching. Capsicum can also be very irritating to the eyes, nose, and throat. Don't use capsicum on sensitive skin or near the eyes. When used in the nose : Capsicum is possibly safe. But, application in the nose can be painful and cause burning pain, sneezing, watery eyes, and runny nose. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Capsicum is likely safe when applied to the skin during pregnancy. Capsicum is possibly safe when taken by mouth as a medicine during the second half of the second trimester and during the third trimester.

DSI001468,Red Clover,C0330783,"Red clover is a perennial herb traditionally used to treat skin disorders such as psoriasis and eczema, whooping cough, and mastitis. It contains compounds known as isoflavones that act as phytoestrogens. An isoflavone extract is widely promoted as a dietary supplement to relieve menopausal symptoms. Preclinical studies suggest red clover extract may act as an estrogen agonist and stimulate proliferation of ER-positive breast cancer cells . However, the isoflavone Biochinin A inhibited aromatase activity and expression and may therefore confer a protective effect. Isoflavone-enriched extracts have shown neuroprotective effects in human cortical neurons and reduced skin aging in mice by increasing collagen . Clinical data show that supplementation with red clover isoflavones improves menopausal symptoms compared with placebo , but systematic reviews are mixed . In postmenopausal women, supplementation alleviated vasomotor and menopausal symptoms . A meta-analysis of a standardized extract suggests potential reductions in total cholesterol in peri- and postmenopausal women, but studies were heterogeneous . Isoflavones may also improve bone loss . In a trial involving osteopenic postmenopausal women, a red clover extract rich in isoflavones, aglycones, and probiotics attenuated bone mineral density loss caused by estrogen deficiency and improved bone turnover . Of concern are findings that red clover inhibits the growth of normal prostate cells and increases resistance of prostate cancer cells to high-dose radiation in vitro . Patients should consult with their physicians before taking red clover supplements. | Red clover (Trifolium pratense) is a flowering plant that grows 15-40 cm high. It's eaten as a legume and used in supplements marketed for female health. Red clover contains chemicals called phytoestrogens that are similar to the hormone estrogen. It grows in many areas, including Europe, central Asia, and northern Africa. People commonly use red clover for symptoms of menopause, weak and brittle bones, breast pain, male-pattern baldness, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any of these uses. Don't confuse red clover with sweet clover. They are different plants.","When taken by mouth : Red clover is commonly consumed in foods. Red clover products contain chemicals called isoflavones. It is possibly safe to take red clover in doses that provide up to 80 mg of isoflavones daily for up to 2 years. It's usually well-tolerated, but might cause muscle aches, nausea, and vaginal bleeding (spotting) in some people. When applied to the skin : Red clover is possibly safe when used for up to 4 weeks. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Red clover is commonly consumed in foods. But it's possibly unsafe when used in medicinal amounts. Red clover might act like estrogen, which could affect hormone balances during pregnancy or breast-feeding. Don't use it. Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Red clover might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by estrogen, don't use red clover.","Formononetin, an isoflavone, induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells by activating the Ras-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in ER-positive breast cancer cells (23). It also inhibited proliferation of human osteosarcoma U2SO cells by decreasing expression of miR-375 and Bcl-2, an apoptotic repressor, while increasing Bax, a pro-apoptotic protein  (27). The isoflavone Biochanin A inhibited activity and gene expression of aromatase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androgen to estrogen (2). In addition, it protected dopaminergic neurons against lipopolysaccharide-induced damage by inhibiting microglial activation and proinflammatory factors (3). An isoflavone-enriched fraction showed neuroprotective activity in human cortical neurons as well, possibly due to antioxidant and estrogenic effects (4).
In a murine model, red clover isoflavones reduced skin aging induced by estrogen deprivation following ovariectomy (5).",Trifolium pratense- Flower | Flower,"Cow clover | Wild clover | Purple clover beebread | Cow grass | Meadow clover | Purple clover | Beebread, Clovone, Cow Clover, Daidzein, Genistein, Isoflavone, Meadow Clover, Miel des Prés, Phytoestrogen, Purple Clover, Trebol Rojo, Trèfle Commun, Trèfle des Prés, Trèfle Pourpre, Trèfle Rouge, Trèfle Rougeâtre, Trèfle Violet, Trefoil, Trifolium, Trifolium pratense, Wild Clover.",Red Clover Isoflavone Extract | Red clover,Red Clover,Red Clover,Red Clover

DSI001474,Blainvillea acmella,C3578352,"Spilanthes acmella is an herbaceous plant that belongs to the family Asteraceae. It is used in traditional medicine throughout Asia and South America, where it is known as Jambu. The leaves are used for culinary purposes, and the flowers have been used for their numbing and pain-relieving properties, earning the plant such common names as the toothache plant. In addition, it has been noted to relieve stomatitis, have taste-activating properties, and to induce a salivary response. In vitro and animal studies suggest that Spilanthes, related species, and their compounds have antimicrobial , antinociceptive , anti-inflammatory , gastroprotective , and taste-activating properties. Spilanthol and acmellonate, compounds derived from this plant, are associated with reduced toothache pain and increased saliva secretion . Other experimental studies suggest diuretic and aphrodisiac effects. In vitro, a hydroethanolic extract of S. acmella produced cytotoxic effects in tumor cell cytoskeletons . In murine models of 5-fluorouracil-induced intestinal mucositis, spilanthol from A. oleracea reduced inflammation . However, human data are lacking.",,"Antinociceptive effects have been attributed to anti-inflammatory properties (11) and engagement of opioid receptors (9). Compounds that induce tingling sensations associated with topical application or chewing of jambu include spilanthol, and to a lesser degree acmellonate (4). Taste-activating alkamide compounds that induce a salivary response have also been identified (4). Spilanthol is among the most active alkamides isolated from aerial parts of A. oleracea to demonstrate insecticidal (14) and acaricidal (15) activity.
In animal models, spilanthol isolated from S. acmella reduced inflammatory responses via NFk-B inactivation (6). Potential mechanisms for gastroprotective effects with rhamnogalacturonan, a polysaccharide isolated from A. oleracea, include protectively binding to the mucosal surface, increasing mucus synthesis, scavenging radicals, and diminishing secretions of acid and pepsin (12). Other research suggests rhamnogalacturonan promotes restoration of epithelial continuity via epithelial cell proliferation and enhances mucin production to promote gastric ulcer healing (13).
In vivo, potential teratogenic activity in embryos may be due to various spilanthol metabolites (21). An animal study found that an S. acmella ethanolic flower extract rich in alkylamides affected male sexual functioning by increasing levels of testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone (5), with the effect being significant and lasting at high doses.",Whole plant,Jambu | Toothache plant | Electric daisy | Paracress | Buzz buttons | Schezuan buttons,Blainvillea acmella,,Spilanthes acmella,

It is available in the form of supplements, but these are not absorbed following oral administration . There are no data to support claims of improved health or anti-aging benefit with SOD supplementation. Animal studies suggest that oral administration of a standardized SOD extract combined with wheat gliadin may protect against oxidative stress-induced cell death and impaired cognitive function . However, there is no supporting literature on the benefits of sublingual SOD. The parenteral formulation, Orgotein, is classified by the FDA as an orphan drug, not as a dietary supplement, for the treatment of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Studies of possible effects of Orgotein in treating radiation-induced cystitis have yielded mixed results . A topical SOD formulation did not significantly improve postradiation fibrosis . | Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is an enzyme found in all living cells. An enzyme is a substance that speeds up certain chemical reactions in the body. Superoxide dismutase helps break down potentially harmful oxygen molecules in cells. This might prevent damage to tissues. Some superoxide dismutase products are made from cows. Others are made from melons or created in a lab. People use superoxide dismutase for osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), heart attack, pneumonia, stress, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Superoxide dismutase is possibly safe when used for up to 6 months.

DSI001519,Fish Oil,C0016157,"Fish oil comes from many types of fish. It is rich in two important omega-3 fatty acids called eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The benefits of fish oil seem to come from its omega-3 fatty acid content. Fish that are especially rich in these oils include mackerel, herring, tuna, and salmon. The body doesn't produce many of its own omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids reduce pain and swelling, and also prevent the blood from clotting easily. Some fish oil products are approved by the FDA as prescription medications to lower triglycerides levels. Fish oil is also available as a supplement. Fish oil supplements do not contain the same amount of fish oil as prescription products, so they cannot be used in place of prescription products. Fish oil supplements are sometimes used for heart health and mental health, but there is no strong evidence to support most of these uses. Do not confuse fish oil with EPA, DHA, cod liver oil, flaxseed oil, krill oil, or shark liver oil. See the separate listings for these topics.","When taken by mouth : Fish oil is likely safe for most people in doses of 3 grams or less daily. Taking more than 3 grams daily might increase the chance of bleeding. Fish oil side effects include heartburn, loose stools, and nosebleeds. Taking fish oil supplements with meals or freezing them can reduce these issues. Consuming high amounts of fish oil from DIETARY sources is possibly unsafe. Some fish are contaminated with mercury and other chemicals. Fish oil supplements typically do not contain these chemicals. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if fish oil is safe or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding :  Fish oil supplements are likely safe when taken by mouth. Taking fish oil does not seem to affect the fetus during pregnancy or the baby while breast-feeding. But swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish should be avoided during pregnancy, by those who may become pregnant, and while breast-feeding. These fish might contain high levels of mercury and may contain other toxins. Limit consumption of other fish to 12 ounces/week (about 3 to 4 servings/week). Consuming fatty fish in high amounts is possibly unsafe. Children : Fish oil supplements are possibly safe when taken by mouth. In adolescents, fish oil has been used safely in doses of up to about 2.2 grams daily for 12 weeks. But young children should not eat more than two ounces of fish per week. Consuming fish oil from DIETARY sources in large amounts is possibly unsafe. Fatty fish contain toxins such as mercury. Eating contaminated fish frequently can cause serious adverse effects in children. Bipolar disorder : Taking fish oil might increase some of the symptoms of this condition. Liver disease : Fish oil might increase the risk of bleeding in people with liver scarring due to liver disease. Diabetes : Taking high doses of fish oil might make it more difficult to control blood sugar levels. Familial adenomatous polyposis : There is some concern that fish oil might further increase the risk of getting cancer in people with this condition. Conditions in which the immune system response is lowered (including HIV/AIDS) : Higher doses of fish oil can lower the body's immune system response. This could be a problem for people whose immune system is already weak. An implanted device to prevent irregular heartbeat : Fish oil might increase the risk of irregular heartbeat in patients with an implanted defibrillator. Stay on the safe side and avoid fish oil supplements. Fish or seafood allergy : Some people who are allergic to seafood such as fish might also be allergic to fish oil supplements. There is no reliable information showing how likely people with seafood allergy are to have an allergic reaction to fish oil.

Alfalfa is a popular treatment for asthma and hay fever . It is also claimed to be a source of vitamins A, C, E, and K and of the minerals, calcium, potassium, phosphorus, and iron . Alfalfa sprout extracts showed neuroprotective and estrogenic activities in preclinical studies. It was found to lower cholesterol levels in small uncontrolled trials . L-canavanine, a toxic amino acid present in alfalfa seeds, was shown to affect T cells . Whether high enough concentrations of this substance are obtained through supplementation is not clear . In another study, rats that were fed alfalfa were more susceptible to colon cancer, although such effects have not been observed in humans . Ingestion of contaminated alfalfa sprouts and seeds resulted in fatalities and salmonellosis . Listeriosis has also been reported following consumption of contaminated alfalfa tablets . | Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) is an herb that some people consume as a source of calcium, potassium, phosphorous, iron, and vitamins A, C, E, and K. Alfalfa is most commonly grown as food for livestock animals. In humans, it's often eaten as a garnish, and seems to prevent cholesterol absorption in the stomach. People use alfalfa for high cholesterol, diabetes, indigestion, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Alfalfa leaves are possibly safe when used short-term. But taking alfalfa in high doses or long-term is likely unsafe. Long-term use might cause reactions similar to the autoimmune disease called lupus in some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Using alfalfa in amounts larger than what is commonly found in food is possibly unsafe during pregnancy and breast-feeding. Alfalfa might act like estrogen in the body. ""Auto-immune diseases"" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions : Alfalfa might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have an auto-immune condition, avoid using alfalfa until more is known. Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Alfalfa might have some of the same effects as estrogen. If you have any condition that is sensitive to estrogen, don't use alfalfa.","Saponins contained in alfalfa act on the cardiovascular, nervous, and digestive systems (1). The hypocholesterolemic and hemolytic activity of the leaves and sprouts of alfalfa are attributed to a steroidal saponin fraction which, along with fiber contained within the plant, binds to cholesterol in vitro. Alkaloids such as stachydrine and l-homo-stachydrine found in the seed are thought responsible for alfalfa’s ability to promote menstrual discharge and for its lactogenic activity (2). Biochanin-A, an isoflavonoid constituent, blocks NF-κB activation by preventing phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, leading to decreased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, thus preventing proliferation and inflammation (17).
Extracts from alfalfa preferentially served as agonists for estrogen receptor beta, and alfalfa increased estrogen-dependent MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation even more than did estradiol (9). The non-protein amino acid constituent, L-canavanine, constitutes 1.5% of the dry weight of alfalfa seeds and alfalfa sprouts. It has been shown to affect human T cells in vitro and induce hematologic and serologic abnormalities characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus in monkeys (13). This is the proposed mechanism by which systemic lupus erythematosus relapse occurs in humans as well (7), although some researchers question whether L-canavanine concentrations in alfalfa are sufficient to cause this effect (8).",Medicago sativa - Herb top | Whole plant | Alfalfa seeds and sprouts are available around the world and used frequently as animal feed.,"Buffalo Herb | Lucerne | Purple Medick | Purple Medicle | Purple Medic | Feuille de Luzerne, Grand Trèfle, Herbe aux Bisons, Herbe à Vaches, Lucerne, Luzerne, Medicago, Medicago sativa, Phyoestrogen, Phyto-œstrogène, Purple Medick, Sanfoin.",Alfalfa protein concentrate | Alfalfa,Alfalfa | Alfalfa Protein,Alfalfa,Alfalfa

DSI001595,Asparagus,C0939866,"Derived from the root of the plant, Chinese asparagus is used in traditional Chinese medicine as a tonic, an expectorant, and to treat a variety of conditions including liver and airway inflammatory diseases . In vitro studies indicate that it has anti-inflammatory effects , and can prevent ethanol-induced cytotoxicity . Other preclinical studies suggest antioxidant , neuroprotective , and anti-asthmatic effects . Some isolated compounds like aspacochioside C and a few spirostanol saponins exhibit moderate cytotoxicity , and the compound methylprotodioscin downregulated proinflammatory cytokine production . However, Chinese asparagus or these constituents have not been studied in humans as a treatment for cancer. Chinese asparagus induced CYP2E1 and 1A2 in animal studies, suggesting potential interactions with drugs metabolized by these enzymes . Clinical relevance has yet to be determined. | Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis) is a plant widely grown as a vegetable. The spears are commonly eaten. The root and seeds are used to make medicine. Asparagus can increase urine production and is also a good source of dietary fiber, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin B6, and several minerals. People use asparagus for high blood pressure, obesity, kidney stones, constipation, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. | Asparagus racemosus is a woody, climbing plant used in Ayurvedic medicine. It's found in India, Sri Lanka, Asia, and Australia. It's considered endangered. Asparagus racemosus might have antioxidant and antibacterial effects. It might also stimulate the immune system. People use Asparagus racemosus for athletic performance, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, lactation, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse Asparagus racemosus with Asparagus officinalis, which is the type of asparagus that is commonly eaten as a vegetable.","When taken by mouth : Asparagus spears are commonly consumed as food. Eating asparagus can make the urine have a pungent smell. There isn't enough reliable information to know if asparagus is safe when used in larger amounts as medicine. It can cause allergic reactions in sensitive people. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if asparagus is safe to use. It can cause allergic reactions in sensitive people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Asparagus spears are commonly consumed as a food. But asparagus extracts are possibly unsafe to use when pregnant. Asparagus extracts have been used for birth control, so they might harm hormone balances during pregnancy. Breast-feeding : Asparagus spears are commonly consumed as a food. There isn't enough reliable information to know if asparagus extracts are safe to use when breast-feeding.

Sulforaphane is a sulfur-rich compound known to benefit human health. Consumption of broccoli sprouts was found to help reduce Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis , but not effective in eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection , and a sulforaphane combined with standard triple therapy (proton pump inhibitor, clarithromycin, and amoxicillin) neither improved the eradication rate nor reduced the occurrence of adverse events . Additional studies reported intake of sprouts to protect against oxidative stress-induced upper airway disease and DNA damage , and long-term consumption to reduce levels of inflammatory markers in overweight subjects . Supplementation with sprouts also enhanced antiviral responses , and glucoraphanin as well as a broccoli sprout beverage may aid the excretion of environmental pollutants. In oncology settings, sulforaphane demonstrated anticancer effects against prostate , breast , and urinary cancer cells , and may protect the skin from ultraviolet radiation . In murine models, a prenatal/maternal broccoli sprouts diet appeared to offer greater preventive effects on breast cancer development compared with postnatal early-life treatment . In patients with prior melanoma, a broccoli sprout extract was found to be well tolerated . A feasibility study involving advanced pancreatic cancer patients found some benefits with broccoli sprout supplementation but noted difficulty in capsule intake by some participants, and to be associated with increased digestive symptoms . In addition, a broccoli sprout extract was found to affect changes in gene expression, but not prostate cancer biomarkers in men undergoing prostate biopsy . Larger studies are needed to determine the chemopreventive potential of broccoli sprouts, but challenges include selection of the source, placebo, dose as well as standardization of the formulation of the intervention material . | Broccoli (Brassica oleracea) is a common vegetable eaten as food. Other varieties of Brassica oleracea include kale, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower. Chemicals in broccoli might help prevent cancer and have antioxidant effects. Also, when broccoli is eaten with a starch, it slows down how quickly sugar from the starch goes into the blood, which might benefit people with diabetes. People use broccoli for high cholesterol, fibromyalgia, preventing certain cancers, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. Don't confuse broccoli with broccoli sprout, or with chemicals found in broccoli, including ascorbigen and indole-3-carbinol. These are not the same. | Broccoli sprouts are young broccoli plants (Brassica oleracea). Broccoli sprouts are rich in the chemical glucoraphanin, which might offer health benefits. The glucoraphanin in broccoli sprout is changed to another compound called sulforaphane during digestion. This chemical has antioxidant effects which might help prevent cancer and liver problems. People use broccoli sprout for prostate cancer, hay fever, asthma, sunburn, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse broccoli sprout with the mature broccoli plant, or with the chemical sulforaphane. These are not the same. | Cabbage is one variety of the Brassica oleracea plant. It's related to broccoli, Brussels sprout, cauliflower, and kale. It's commonly eaten as a vegetable. Different types of cabbage are grown for food. Cabbage leaf contains high amounts of vitamin K1, as well as other nutrients. It also contains chemicals that might help prevent cancer and help with wound healing. People use cabbage for hard, painful breasts during breastfeeding. It is also used for cancer, knee pain, osteoarthritis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse cabbage with other varieties of the Brassica oleracea species, including broccoli, broccoli sprout, Brussels sprout, cauliflower, collard, kale, and kohlrabi. These are not the same. | Kale (Brassica oleracea) is a dark, leafy vegetable that is commonly eaten as a food source. Kale can also be used as a medicine. Kale contains chemicals that are thought to help prevent cancer. Chemicals in kale might also have antioxidant activity.

Induction of phase 2 enzymes occurs through antioxidant response element-driven gene expression, with targets including NAD(P)H:quinone reductase, heme oxygenase 1, and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase regulated by nuclear factor E2 related factor (13). Sulforaphane also suppresses cancer development through various molecular targets. It induces G2/M cell cycle arrest via cyclin-dependent kinases and triggers dose-dependent apoptosis and inhibits histone deacetylase by its metabolites in vitro (13). In a triple-negative breast cancer animal model, sulforaphane protection against cancer stem-like cell proliferation was attributed to suppression of the Cripto-mediated pathway and/or the Cripto/Alk4 protein complex (16).
In a small human study, broccoli sprout homogenates enhanced antiviral defense responses via peripheral blood NK cell activation and increased granzyme B production (14).",Red cabbage - Leaves,"

It is used in traditional medicine in Asia where it is often mixed with other medicinal mushrooms such as reishi and maitake, and promoted as an adjunctive treatment during cancer therapy. It also has traditional applications in the treatment of hemorrhage, hemostasis, and menstrual disorders . Preclinical studies have identified polysaccharide-protein complexes in PL that may have immunomodulating effects . In animal models, the polyphenolic constituent demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties, which may protect against injury and other syndromes involving infarcts, hematomas, or hemorrhages . Other constituents such as interfungin A may help prevent protein modification in hyperglycemic states . PL extracts have exhibited a variety of properties in human cancer cell lines . In vitro and animal studies suggest antiangiogenic and antioxidant effects . Antiproliferative effects against breast , colon , liver , lung , oral , prostate , and skin cancers have also been reported. In addition, PL and its constituents have exhibited chemosensitizing effects in pancreatic and colon cancer cells . Studies in humans are very limited. Preliminary data in pancreatic cancer patients suggest PL may improve outcomes in part by improving adherence to adjuvant chemotherapy . There are also a few case reports of tumor regression following consumption of PL . However, well-designed trials are needed to confirm these effects.",,"Polysaccharide-protein complexes found in PL have immunomodulating (1), antiangiogenic, and antioxidant properties (5). Furopyranone compounds in PL that inhibit protein glycation may have applications in preventing or treating diabetic complications (4) (23). In non-obese diabetic mice, a PL-polysaccharide extract enhanced function of macrophages, as well as dendritic, NK, T, and B cells, and prevented inflammation by inhibiting IFNγ, IL2, and TNFα via TH1 cells and macrophages. It also upregulated IL4 expression in TH2 cells (23).
Anti-inflammatory activities of inotilone isolated from PL might be due to reduced levels of malondialdehyde, inducible NO synthase, COX2, NFκB, and MMP9, as well as increased activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase via TNFα and NO suppression (25).
The phenolic compound hispidin protected against cytotoxicity, DNA damage, and hydroxyl radical formation (26).
PL inhibited proliferation in human colon cancer cells via decreased Bcl2 and cyclin B1 and increased cytochrome C (9). Another study similarly found a PL extract induced G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis in human colon carcinoma cells via p21 upregulation, cyclin D1 and Bcl2 downregulation, release of cytochrome C, and activation of caspases 9, 3, and 8 (10). Decreased cyclin-dependent kinases CDK2, 4, and 6, and dose-dependent apoptosis of lung cancer cells after treatment with PL were also observed (12).",Mycelia,Meshimakobu | Meshima | Song gen | Sanghuang,Phellinus linteus,Phellinus linteus,Phellinus linteus,

The root is used to make medicine. Blue cohosh is not a safe plant. However, it still is available as a supplement. Sometimes the supplements do not include warnings. Blue cohosh is used for stimulating the uterus and starting labor; starting menstruation; stopping muscle spasms; as a laxative; and for treating colic, sore throat, cramps, hiccups, epilepsy, hysterics, inflammation of the uterus, infection of the female organs (pelvic inflammatory disease), over-growth of uterine tissue (endometriosis),  and joint conditions. In foods, the roasted seeds of blue cohosh are used as a coffee substitute.","Blue cohosh is LIKELY UNSAFE for adults when taken by mouth. It can cause diarrhea, stomach cramps, chest pain, increased blood pressure, increased blood sugar, and other severe side effects. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : It is LIKELY UNSAFE to take blue cohosh by mouth during pregnancy. Some of the chemicals in blue cohosh can cause birth defects. When taken by the mother late in pregnancy, blue cohosh can cause severe heart problems in the newborn baby. It can also be toxic to the mother. Many midwives still use blue cohosh to make childbirth easier, because blue cohosh causes the uterus to contract. But this is a dangerous practice, and it should be avoided. Heart conditions : There is concern that blue cohosh might worsen some heart conditions. These conditions include chest pain (angina) and high blood pressure. Blue cohosh might cause blood vessels in the heart to become smaller and decrease oxygen flow to the heart. It might also increase blood pressure and cause rapid heartbeat. Don't use blue cohosh if you have a heart condition. Diabetes : There is some concern that blue cohosh might make diabetes worse. It can raise blood sugar levels in some people who have diabetes. Diarrhea : Blue cohosh might make diarrhea symptoms worse. Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Blue cohosh might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use blue cohosh.",,,"Actée à Grappes Bleu, Blue Ginseng, Caulophylle, Caulophylle Faux-Pigamon, Caulophyllum, Caulophyllum thalictroides, Cohosh Azul, Cohosh Bleu, Graines à Chapelet, Léontice Faux-Pigamon, Papoose Root, Cohosh Azul, Squaw Root, Yellow Ginseng.",Caulophyllum thalictroides,Blue Cohosh,,Blue Cohosh

DSI001809,Phosphate,C1601799,"Phosphorus is an essential mineral found in many foods. In the diet and body, phosphorus usually binds to other minerals in the form of phosphate salts. Phosphates are involved in cell structure, energy transport and storage, vitamin function, and many other essential processes in the body. Phosphate salts can act as laxatives by causing more fluid to be drawn into the intestines and making the gut push out its contents faster. People use phosphate salts for bowel cleansing, low blood levels of phosphate, constipation, high blood levels of calcium, and heartburn. They are also used for athletic performance, osteoporosis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these other uses.","When taken by mouth : Phosphate salts are likely safe when consumed in the diet, or when supplements are used appropriately for a short time. Phosphate salts might cause side effects such as stomach upset, diarrhea, headache, and others. Phosphate salts (as phosphorous) are possibly unsafe when taken in doses higher than 4 grams daily for adults 70 years and younger, or in doses higher than 3 grams daily for people over 70 years. Regular long-term use can upset the balance of phosphates and other chemicals in the body and should be monitored by a healthcare professional to avoid serious side effects. When given as an enema (rectally) : Phosphate salts are likely safe for most people when inserted into the rectum appropriately and short-term. But these products shouldn't be used more than once daily. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Phosphate salts are commonly consumed in the diet. Phosphate salts are possibly unsafe when taken in amounts above the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL is 3.5 grams daily during pregnancy and 4 grams daily while breast-feeding. Children : Phosphate salts are commonly consumed in the diet. Phosphate salts are possibly unsafe when taken in amounts that exceed the tolerable upper intake level (UL). The UL is 3 grams daily for children 1-8 years old and 4 grams daily for children 9 years and older. Giving a sodium phosphate enema to children OVER 2 years of age is likely safe when no more than one dose is given every 24 hours. But it is likely unsafe to give more than one dose every 24 hours, or to give a sodium phosphate enema to children who are under 2 years of age. Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions: : Sodium phosphate can cause damage to the intestines in some people. If you have an obstruction or have an inflammatory GI condition, avoid using sodium phosphate. High levels of calcium in the blood (hypercalcemia): : Use phosphate salts cautiously if you have hypercalcemia. Too much phosphate could cause calcium to be deposited where it shouldn't be in your body. High levels of phosphate in the blood : People with Addison's disease, severe heart and lung disease, kidney disease, thyroid problems, or liver disease are more likely to have too much phosphate in their blood when they take phosphate salts. Use phosphate salts only while under the care of a healthcare professional if you have one of these conditions.

DSI001859,carnitine,C0007258,"Carnitine is a nutrient that plays an important role in fatty acid absorption and mitochondrial function. It is synthesized endogenously from lysine and methionine and is also found in meat and dairy products. Deficiencies can be caused by genetic disorders, malnutrition, malabsorption and kidney dialysis, and affect the heart, skeletal muscles, liver, nerve, and endocrine functions. Carnitine supplements are used to enhance physical performance and to treat fatigue, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, chronic fatigue syndrome, liver disorders, and cancer. A meta-analysis determined that supplementation improves body weight and BMI in overweight and obese individuals . It also alleviated muscle damage in resistance trained and untrained groups , muscle wasting in patients with pemphigus vulgaris , and prevented cardiovascular disease in hemodialysis patients . Long-term supplementation has been correlated with improved myocardial mechanical performance, reduction in ventricular arrhythmias and increased exercise tolerance , and higher levels of carnitine were associated with lower risks of cardiovascular events and recurrent stroke after ischemic stroke . Carnitine also improved oxidative and inflammatory markers in patients with cardiovascular disease , but did not reduce risk of death or heart failure in patients with anterior acute myocardial infarction . In critically-ill patients, supplements improved nutritional status indicators, which have a key role in prognosis of diseases and adjunctive use improved symptoms of autism spectrum disorder in children and adolescents . Preliminary findings also suggest improvement in symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome and physical performance in patients undergoing dialysis for end-stage renal disease , but data on benefits against fatigue associated with multiple sclerosis are inconclusive . Some trials reported enhanced physical performance , and improved aerobic capacity and exercise tolerance whereas others yielded mixed results . L-carnitine used by itself or in combination with clomiphene citrate may help treat idiopathic male infertility , although it did not improve sperm count or motility . An antioxidant formulation containing L-carnitine was also ineffective in improving semen parameters or DNA integrity . In women with polycystic ovary syndrome, supplementation may improve mental health parameters and biomarkers of oxidative stress . Small studies in oncology settings found supplementation to improve nutritional status and quality of life in pancreatic cancer patients , and to reduce vismodegib-associated muscle spasms . L-carnitine by itself or in combination with Coenzyme Q10 may also relieve chemotherapy-related fatigue, reduce fatigue in both younger hypothyroid patients receiving levothyroxine, and in thyroid cancer patients who have hypothyroidism, post-surgery . But it did not improve fatigue in patients with invasive malignancies . Confirmatory data are also needed to determine if chemo-induced carnitine insufficiency increases malaise or fatigue . In prostate cancer patients initiating androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), a low-carb diet reversed ADT-induced metabolic abnormalities which included reductions in acylcarnitine . Acetyl-L-carnitine, an ester derivative available as a supplement, is often used as a neuroprotective agent. It may help reduce diabetic neuropathy and improve cognition in patients with severe hepatic encephalopathy . In elderly patients with dysthymic disorder, it was found comparable to fluoxetine , but ineffective against Alzheimer’s disease .In cancer settings, acetyl-L-carnitine increased chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) , which persisted at the 2-year follow-up . Current guidelines do not recommend this supplement for preventing CIPN .",,"Carnitine is a non-essential amino acid, with only the L-isomer utilized in human bodies. It is available in many foods, and bioavailability from dietary sources is much higher (54%–87%) than from oral supplements (14%–18%) (48). L-carnitine plays a role in the transport of long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane, facilitating beta-oxidation of fatty acids and acting as an intracellular energy reservoir of acetyl groups. In deficiencies, these acyl esters accumulate and cause deleterious effects including inhibition of adenine nucleotide translocase, which impedes ATP production (5). Carnitine supplementation prevents oxidative stress and ameliorates mitochondrial function (29). L-carnitine may protect against statin-induced cellular damage via antioxidative properties in rat hepatocytes (31).
Animal studies show L-carnitine has cardioprotective effects by preventing skeletal muscle myopathy (14) and may improve myocardial metabolic patterns, reduce necrosis, diminish enzymatic infarct size, and preserve left ventricular function (8). Effects on congestive heart failure-associated myopathy may be due to caspase inhibition and decreased TNF-alpha levels (14). Metabolism of dietary L-carnitine by intestinal microbiota produced trimethylamine-N-oxide, a proatherogenic species, which accelerated atherosclerosis (30). Anticatabolic effects may occur by improving nitrogen balance either via increased protein synthesis or reduced protein degradation. Other studies show it prevents oxidative stress and ameliorates mitochondrial function (29). Carnitine is often proposed for the treatment of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Possible mechanisms include inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 activity, β-oxidation of fatty acids, and increased storage in the body tissues (49). It may help cancer-related cachexia by reducing proteasome activity (50), but studies in humans are needed.
In one clinical trial, carnitine reversed hyperthyroidism by acting as a peripheral antagonist of thyroid hormone action (3). In hemodialysis patients, carnitine has anti-inflammatory and anticoagulation effects which may contribute to its cardioprotective activity (24).","Meat, dairy products, beans, avocado",Vitamin BT | Vitamin B7 | ALCAR,L-tartrate de carnitine ,Carnitine Silicate | Carnitine | Carnitine Orotate,Carnitine,

It does not contain any catechins, the major flavonoids present in green and black teas . In vitro and animal studies have shown that rooibos can modulate immune function , exhibit anti-inflammatory effects , and prevent oxidative stress . Animal studies suggest that it may prevent chromosomal aberrations and tumor mutagenesis . In other lab studies, topically applied rooibos protected against microsomal lipid peroxidation and reduced tumor formation , and a rooibos tea extract appeared to protect against radiation damage . However, these effects have not been confirmed in humans. Preliminary data suggests rooibos may inhibit angiotensin-converting enzyme in healthy volunteers , which may benefit cardiovascular health. However, studies in humans are very limited and further research is needed. Rat studies suggest that prolonged exposure to rooibos may affect the reproductive system, impair fertility, or affect liver and kidney function . In humans, a few cases of liver toxicity with long-term use or ingesting large amounts have been reported. Because compounds isolated from rooibos leaves demonstrated estrogenic activity , patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use caution before taking rooibos. | Rooibos is a fragrant, caffeine-free tea. It is made from the leaves and stems of a tree called Aspalathus linearis. This tree grows in South Africa,  where rooibos tea is the national drink.

Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if rooibos is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.","Rooibos was shown to enhance the activity of glutathione-S transferase and UDP-glucuronosyl transferase in rat livers  (11) (16), allowing cells to protect against oxidative stress, and to reduce the effects of hepatocarcinogens. A study of oxidative stress in rats found that serum superoxide dismutase and urine 8-hydroxy-2’-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) concentrations (as markers for DNA damage) were significantly reduced following administration of rooibos (17). Some studies have shown that the non-oxidized teas have greater antimutagenic effects compared to the oxidized forms. This is probably due to reduction in total polyphenol content with oxidization (11) (18) (19). The anti-inflammatory effects of rooibos are thought to be due to its inhibition of COX-2 enzyme (5).
Rooibos also modulates immune function: It induces higher IL6, IL10 and IFN-gamma levels and increases cell-mediated immunity (3); and increases IL2 levels while suppressing IL4 (4).
In other studies, rooibos significantly decreased glucocorticoid levels in rats and steroid metabolite ratios linked to metabolic disorders-cortisol:cortisone in humans and CORT:testosterone in rats (23).

Its bark has been used for thousands of years in China and Europe as a remedy for fevers and pain. Aspirin is derived from salicin, an active compound in willow bark. In vitro, willow bark extracts and salicin have exhibited anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects , but data in humans are limited. A few studies suggest that willow bark may help manage back pain , but studies of osteoarthritis are mixed with negative findings for rheumatoid arthritis . Aspirin has been studied for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases as well as cancer . However, willow bark should not be used as a substitute for aspirin because of the variation in its potency. Children should not be given willow bark because of the potential for developing Reye syndrome, a serious condition associated with the use of aspirin . | Willow bark comes from several varieties of willow tree, including white (Salix alba or European), black (Salix nigra or pussy), crack, and purple willow. Willow bark contains a chemical called salicin, which is similar to aspirin. It has pain and fever reducing effects in the body. People commonly use willow bark for back pain, osteoarthritis, fever, flu, muscle pain, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using willow bark for COVID-19.","When taken by mouth : Willow bark is possibly safe when used for up to 12 weeks. It might cause diarrhea, heartburn, and vomiting in some people. It can also cause itching, rash, and allergic reactions, particularly in people who are allergic to aspirin. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : There isn't enough reliable information to know if willow bark is safe to use when pregnant. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Breast-feeding : It is possibly unsafe to use willow bark while breast-feeding. Willow bark contains chemicals that can enter breast milk and have harmful effects on the nursing infant. Don't use it if you are breast-feeding. Children : Willow bark is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth for viral infections such as colds and flu. There is some concern that, like aspirin, it might increase the risk of developing Reye syndrome. Stay on the safe side and don't use willow bark in children. Bleeding disorders : Willow bark might increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding disorders. Kidney disease : Willow bark might reduce blood flow through the kidneys. This might lead to kidney failure in some people. If you have kidney disease, don't use willow bark. Sensitivity to aspirin : People with asthma, stomach ulcers, diabetes, gout, hemophilia, hypoprothrombinemia, or kidney or liver disease might be sensitive to aspirin and also willow bark. Using willow bark might cause serious allergic reactions. Avoid use. Surgery : Willow bark might slow blood clotting. It could cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using willow bark at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Although anti-inflammatory activity is mostly attributed to salicin (13), the main bioactive compound in willow bark, catechol and flavonoid compounds have also been found to be responsible (12). Willow bark inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and COX-2, and nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NF-κB (1). It was also found to significantly raise low glutathione levels, thereby limiting lipid peroxidation (14).
Antiproliferative effects in human colon and lung cancer cells are due to growth inhibition and apoptotic induction (15).

DSI001908,Melatonin,C1527137,"Melatonin is produced endogenously in humans by the pineal gland. Although the exact mechanism of action is unknown, it is thought to control the circadian pacemaker and promote sleep . Small amounts of melatonin are found in fruits, nuts, olive oil, and wine. The supplemental form is used as a sleep-aid. Melatonin may decrease sleep latency and improve sleep duration , although randomized trials have produced mixed data . Meta analyses did not find any significant effects with melatonin on insomnia disorder , secondary sleep disorders associated with medical, neurological, or substance abuse disorders , or on sleep quality in menopausal women , but supplementation improved subjective sleep quality in patients with traumatic brain injury and Parkinson’s disease , and cognitive outcomes in patients with Alzheimer’s disease . Melatonin may also benefit those with jet lag .Melatonin was shown to decrease surgery-associated anxiety and pain , frequency of migraine attacks and perioperative anxiety , but there is insufficient evidence for its use to improve delirium in hospitalized patients , to improve depression or depressive symptoms , or for seasonal affective disorder (SAD) . Studies in patients with nocturia and those in ICU produced mixed results . Whether it can help in benzodiazepine withdrawal is also unclear . Data suggest benefits of child-appropriate, prolonged-release melatonin for long-term treatment in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and insomnia . The American Academy of Neurology guidelines recommend using melatonin, starting with a low-dose, for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and sleep disturbance if behavioral strategies have not been helpful, and if contributing coexisting conditions and use of concomitant medications have been addressed . Clinical trials evaluating melatonin as a monotherapy or in combination with other agents, and in patients with solid tumors reported improvements in fatigue , and quality of life and survival time but a systematic review reported no such benefits . Melatonin also did not improve appetite, weight, or quality of life in cancer patients with cachexia . In studies of postmenopausal breast cancer survivors, short-term supplementation did not influence estradiol levels but improved sleep quality . Data also suggest melatonin may help reduce incidence of chemotherapy side effects including thrombocytopenia, asthenia, and neurotoxicity ; improve cognitive function, sleep quality and depressive symptoms ; minimize radiotherapy-induced reduction in blood cell counts ; protect against radiation-induced genotoxicity ; and reduce the incidence of oral mucositis caused by chemo- and radiotherapy . In addition, melatonin was found comparable to zolpidem in affecting sleep duration, latency, efficiency, and disturbance in colorectal cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy . But in survivors of childhood cancers, there were no effects on sleep or neurocognitive performance . According to a case report, oral melatonin may delay menopause in pre-menopausal women by modulating levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and estrogen . | Melatonin is a hormone made in the body. It regulates night and day cycles or sleep-wake cycles. Melatonin in supplements is usually made in a lab. Darkness triggers the body to make more melatonin, which signals the body to sleep. Light decreases melatonin production and signals the body to be awake. Some people who have trouble sleeping have low levels of melatonin. It's thought that adding melatonin from supplements might help them sleep. People most commonly use melatonin for insomnia and improving sleep in different conditions, such as jet lag. It is also used for depression, chronic pain, dementia, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using melatonin for COVID-19.","When taken by mouth : Melatonin is likely safe for most adults when used short-term. Melatonin is possibly safe when taken long-term. It's been used safely for up to 2 years. But it can cause some side effects including headache, sleepiness, dizziness, and nausea. Don't drive or use machinery for 4-5 hours after taking melatonin. When applied to the skin : Melatonin is likely safe for most adults when used short-term. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Melatonin is possibly unsafe when regularly taken by mouth or in high doses while trying to become pregnant. Melatonin might have effects similar to birth control, making it more difficult to become pregnant. There isn't enough reliable information to know if melatonin is safe to use when pregnant. Until more is known, it's best not to use melatonin while pregnant or trying to become pregnant. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if melatonin is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Melatonin is possibly safe when taken by mouth, short-term. Melatonin is usually well tolerated when taken in doses up to 3 mg daily in children and 5 mg daily in adolescents. There is some concern that melatonin might interfere with development during adolescence. Melatonin should only be used in children with a medical need. There isn't enough evidence to know if melatonin is safe in children when taken by mouth, long-term. Bleeding disorders : Melatonin might make bleeding worse in people with bleeding disorders. Depression : Melatonin can make symptoms of depression worse. High blood pressure : Melatonin can raise blood pressure in people who are taking certain medications to control blood pressure. Avoid using it. Seizure disorders : Using melatonin might increase the risk of having a seizure. Transplant recipients : People who have had a transplant often take medications to suppress the immune system. Melatonin can increase immune function. This might interfere with the effects of some transplant medications.","Melatonin is an endogenously produced indolamine hormone secreted by the pineal gland in humans. Nocturnal secretion is regulated by circadian rhythms and nighttime darkness (17), and melatonin is thought to control the circadian pacemaker and promote sleep. Ironically, it is associated with wakefulness and activity in nocturnal animals (14). As levels of melatonin increase, an associated drop in core body temperature occurs. Both elderly and depressed patients tend to have lower basal levels of melatonin (2).
Melatonin is a free-radical scavenger (18) (38) and enhances antioxidative enzyme activities (39), interacting with cytosolic calmodulin and stimulating IL-4 production in bone marrow T-lymphocytes (1). In vitro and animal studies suggest that antitumor effects may occur through antimitotic or immunomodulatory activity. In vitro studies demonstrate antiproliferative effects on human breast cancer (HS578T) (19) and mouse melanoma (B16BL6, PG19) (8). Decreases in breast cancer metastasis may occur via modulation of Rho-associated kinase protein-1 expression (41). Melatonin reduces proliferation of PC-3 and LNCaP cells in mice, but has no effect on apoptosis (9). Its effect on tumor cell growth may be mediated in part by melatonin receptor signaling (20) (21). In endometrial cancer cells, it interferes with estrogen receptor expression (22). Other laboratory studies suggest that melatonin behaves both as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and as an aromatase inhibitor (42) (43). In a murine model, it modulated expression of genes crucial for DNA repair — Ogg1, Apex1, and Xrcc1 — in peripheral blood cells, to reduce X-ray-induced DNA damage (45).","Small amounts of melatonin are found in fruits, nuts, olive oil and wine.","MLT | Pineal hormone | 5-Methoxy-N-Acetyltryptamine, MEL, Melatonina, Mélatonine, MLT, N-Acetyl-5-Methoxytryptamine, N-Acétyl-5-Méthoxytryptamine, Pineal Hormone.",Melatonin,Melatonin,Melatonin,Melatonin

DSI001977,Cannabis,C0024808,"Cannabis sativa is an annual flowering herb native to East Asia, but is now cultivated around the world. Its uses as a source of industrial fiber, seed oil, and as a recreational agent date back thousands of years across cultures. It has also been employed in traditional medicine as an analgesic, hypnotic, and hallucinogenic, as a sedative, and for reducing inflammation. Preparations containing flowers (marijuana) and leaves; hashish derived from the resinous extract of the plant are consumed orally; by smoking in cigarettes, cigars, pipes, water pipes, or “blunts” (cannabis rolled in the tobacco-leaf wrapper from a cigar); or by vaporizing. Cannabis tinctures, teas, ointments, and oil-based extracts that can be mixed into food products are also popular. It is currently the most widely used illicit agent by more than 147 million people worldwide , and the common route of consumption is via inhalation. Because of the potential for high abuse and dependence, and its classification as a Schedule I agent by the Controlled Substances Act in 1970, cannabis use is a controversial subject in the US.Pharmacologic investigations over the last few decades revealed cannabinoids (terpenoids) to be the active constituents. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the chief psychoactive component whereas cannabidiol (CBD) is a major secondary non-psychoactive cannabinoid, and may modulate the effects of THC. It has antipsychotic, anticonvulsive, and anxiolytic effects. When co-administered, CBD was reported to mitigate the adverse psychotropic and cardiovascular effects associated with THC .Cannabis has been studied for its utility in treating pain, symptoms of neurological disorders, AIDS and cancer.A systematic review reported significant relief from pain due to neuropathy, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, and mixed chronic pain following cannabinoid use compared to placebo but another review determined placebo as a contributor to pain reductions . In addition, a 4-year prospective study involving 1,514 patients with chronic non-cancer pain did not find evidence that cannabis use decreased pain severity or interference, or exerted an opioid-sparing effect . In a Cochrane review of four trials involving 48 epileptic patients, short-term CBD use was reported to be well tolerated with no adverse effects, but limited evidence precluded definitive conclusions to be reached on efficacy . Newer randomized studies of patients with either Lennox-Gastaut syndrome or Dravet syndrome, both rare forms of epilepsy, reported effectiveness of Epidiolex, an oral CBD solution, for reducing the frequency of seizures . This is now an FDA-approved drug . Additionally, data indicate benefits of cannabinoids for treating spasticity and neuropathic pain in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients . The American Academy of Neurology issued a Summary of Systematic Reviews for Clinicians indicating that oral cannabis extract is effective in reducing patient-reported spasticity scores and central pain or painful spasms associated with MS .Conclusions from a large, comprehensive review of 79 trials (6462 subjects) indicate low-quality evidence to address weight gain from HIV infection, sleep disorders, increasing appetite, and for Tourette syndrome, along with elevated risk of short-term adverse effects . The evidence for recommending cannabinoids to treat symptoms of dyskinesia, Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, irritable bowel syndrome, and addiction has been deemed unavailable or insufficient .In oncology settings, preclinical findings from 34 studies suggest selective cytotoxic effects of cannabinoids against glioma cells (sparing normal brain cells) via apoptosis, toxicity, autophagy and necrosis . A clinical study of 9 patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme receiving chemotherapy did not find any benefit with intratumoral THC, but it was well tolerated . Data from another study involving 21 glioblastoma patients, in which oromucosal whole plant extract nabiximols (contains THC +CBD) was used, have yet to be published . In addition, a cannabinoid resin extract was reported to affect dose-dependent disease control in a patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia . But a retrospective observational study showed that concomitant use of cannabis during immunotherapy with nivolumab was associated with reduction in tumor response rate in patients with advanced melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, and renal clear cell carcinoma. Progression-free survival and overall survival remained unaffected .For symptom management, systematic reviews show that patients who used cannabis-based products experienced less chemo-induced nausea and vomiting compared to those on placebo group or on antiemetics. The differences were not statistically significant and adverse effects including “feeling high,” dizziness, sedation, and dysphoria were reported, resulting in a high dropout rate. Noteworthy are the 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines on antiemetics that recommend dronabinol and nabilone for nausea and vomiting, which is resistant to standard therapy .Findings on effectiveness of cannabis against cancer pain are encouraging. Data from four trials indicate reductions in pain with orally administered THC and with nabiximols spray in advanced cancer patients . In addition, incorporating medical cannabis early in the treatment as opposed to delayed start resulted in decreased opioid use along with improved pain control in this population . Cannabis has also been investigated for its role in ameliorating cancer-related anorexia-cachexia syndrome (CACS), but neither cannabis extract nor THC were found useful in a randomized trial of patients with advanced cancer . Additional case reports suggest that dronabinol may be useful for managing persistent symptomatic paraneoplastic night sweats in cancer patients . In a randomized uncontrolled study, THC-containing medicinal cannabis was found to improve sleep, functional well-being, and quality of life in patients with high grade gliomas .Although some data suggest potential benefits, cannabis remains a contentious issue because non-medical use is associated with high risk of addiction, especially when used from an early age ; dependence ; adverse effects ; and with withdrawal syndrome (irritability, sleeping difficulties, dysphoria, craving, and anxiety) that makes cessation tough, eventually leading to relapse. Cannabis use was also reported to elevate the risk of creating false memories .It is also important to note that synthetic cannabinoid drugs cause more serious adverse effects compared to natural cannabis, and include respiratory difficulties, hypertension, tachycardia, chest pain, muscle twitches, acute renal failure, anxiety, agitation, psychosis, suicidal ideation and cognitive impairment .Some studies suggest utility of nicotine patch in decreasing negative affect-related withdrawal symptoms in individuals with cannabis use disorder ; and in patients with cannabis dependence, nabiximols combined with psychosocial interventions reduced cannabis use . However, an incentive-based intervention was ineffective in individuals with early psychosis and problematic cannabis use .Despite the controversy surrounding cannabis use, California became the first state to legalize it for “medical use” in 1996. As of May 2021, it is available in 35 more states and the District of Columbia (DC) as a medicinal agent, with 16 states and DC also allowing recreational use. Current indications that qualify for medical cannabis use include cancer symptoms, non-cancer pain, glaucoma, AIDS, epilepsy, and MS. However, cannabis use remains illegal under federal law. Following a review of available scientific evidence, the Institute of Medicine , and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommend that further research be done to develop a comprehensive understanding of the health effects of cannabis , which can inform medical cannabis policy. Barriers to research include regulatory issues that involve the FDA, Drug Enforcement Administration, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and Institutional Review Boards; procuring cannabis for studies; and methodological challenges of establishing an acceptable route of administration and standardized doses .With the growing popularity of cannabis among cancer patients, it is important that oncology providers be aware of emerging data so they can counsel patients about its use . The consensus of an expert panel in supportive cancer care is that the evidence to recommend cannabinoids for the management of chemo-induced nausea and vomiting, nausea from advanced cancer, cancer-associated anorexia-cachexia, and taste disturbance is insufficient . The panel also recommends against the use of cannabinoids as an adjuvant analgesic for cancer pain . Additionally, a systematic review determined that rigorous evidence is lacking to inform the dosing, safety, and efficacy of cannabinoids in children with cancer . | Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is an herbal drug. It contains chemicals called cannabinoids, including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). The cannabinoids in cannabis work by binding to specific sites in the brain and on the nerves. There are over 100 cannabinoids in cannabis, but THC and CBD are the most well-studied. Cannabinoids are found in the highest levels in the leaves and flowers of the plant. Cannabis is commonly used as a recreational drug. People also commonly use cannabis for multiple sclerosis (MS) and nerve pain. It is also used for nausea, vomiting, migraine, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using cannabis for COVID-19. Don't confuse cannabis with hemp. Hemp contains very low levels of THC, less than 0.3% according to legal standards. Both hemp and cannabis also contain cannabinoids such as CBD, cannabidivarin (CBDV), cannabigerol (CBG), and others. Unlike hemp, cannabis is illegal under federal law in the US. It is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. But some states have legalized or decriminalized recreational use.","When taken by mouth : Cannabis is possibly unsafe when used in large amounts or long-term. Edible cannabis containing 50 mg or more of THC has been linked with serious side effects. Regularly taking large amounts of cannabis might cause cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). CHS leads to severe nausea and vomiting that doesn't respond to typical anti-nausea drugs. Also, using cannabis for at least 1-2 weeks can cause dependence. When sprayed into the mouth : A specific cannabis extract (Sativex) is possibly safe. This is a prescription-only product in the UK and Canada. It is not approved in the US. When inhaled : Cannabis is possibly unsafe when used in large amounts or long-term. Smoking or vaping cannabis can cause breathing problems. Vaping products containing THC have been linked to serious lung injury. Regularly smoking cannabis may cause CHS and/or dependence. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Using cannabis is unsafe during pregnancy. Cannabis passes through the placenta and can slow the growth of the fetus and increase the risk for premature birth, stillbirth, childhood leukemia, abnormalities, or the need for intensive care after birth. It can also lead to lower intelligence and emotional problems in the child when they grow up. It also increases the risk for anemia and high blood pressure while pregnant. Breast-feeding : Using cannabis is likely unsafe while breast-feeding. The chemicals in cannabis pass into breastmilk and stay in breastmilk for longer than 6 weeks, even after cannabis use has been stopped. These chemicals might slow down the development of the baby. Avoid all cannabis use if planning to breastfeed. Bipolar disorder : Using cannabis might make manic symptoms worse in people with bipolar disorder. Heart disease : Cannabis might cause fast heartbeat and high blood pressure. It might also increase the risk of having heart attack. Allergies to fruits and vegetables : Cannabis might increase the risk of an allergic reaction in people with allergies to foods like tomatoes, bananas, and citrus fruit. Depression : Using cannabis might increase the risk for depression. It can also worsen symptoms of depression and increase thoughts about suicide in those who already have depression. Diabetes : Cannabis use might make it harder to control blood sugar levels. It might also increase the risk for long-term complications from diabetes. Until more is known, be cautious using cannabis. Epilepsy : High doses of cannabis might cause seizures in people with epilepsy. There have been several reports where high doses of cannabis have caused seizures. Weakened immune system : Because cannabis can be contaminated with fungus, there's some concern that using cannabis might put people with weakened immune systems at risk for fungal infections. Liver disease : It is unclear if cannabis worsens chronic liver disease. Until more is known, be cautious using cannabis. Lung diseases : Cannabis can make lung problems worse. Regular use might increase the risk of lung cancer. Some people develop a type of lung disease called emphysema. Irregular heartbeat : Cannabis might increase the risk for dangerous irregular heartbeat in people at high risk for these conditions. Schizophrenia : Using cannabis might make symptoms of schizophrenia worse. Quitting smoking : Using cannabis might make it harder to quit smoking. Stroke : Using cannabis after having a stroke might increase the risk of having a second stroke. Surgery : Cannabis affects the central nervous system. It might slow the central nervous system too much when combined with anesthesia and other medications during and after surgery. Stop using cannabis at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Cannabinoids are the active constituents that mimic endogenous cannabinoids, and their activity is based on a receptor-mediated mechanism. THC exerts psychoactive and pain-relieving effects by acting as a partial agonist of cannabinoid receptors CB1 (predominantly expressed in the central nervous system) and CB2 (associated with the immune system). CB1 and CB2 are members of the G protein-coupled receptors (30), and are activated through inhibition of adenylate-cyclase. The activation in turn inhibits the release of neurotransmitters acetylcholine and glutamate, while indirectly affecting opioid and serotonin receptors, gamma-aminobutyric acid and N-methly-D-asparate (31). The antiemetic effect of nabilone is due to its ability to activate CB receptors in the brain, which mediate nausea and vomiting (32).Mechanisms by which CBD exerts its effects include activation of the serotonin receptor 5-HT1A (33); inhibition of reuptake and/or metabolism of anandamide, an endocannabinoid; activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV1) channels; inhibition of adenosine reuptake; agonism of PPAR-gamma receptors; by intracellular increase in calcium ions; as well as via anti-oxidative activity (34).After inhalation of cannabis, THC is detectable in plasma within seconds, with peak plasma concentration achieved within 3-10 minutes. The bioavailability of THC varies and depends on the depth of inhalation, puff duration, and breath-hold. The systemic bioavailability is estimated to be ∼23-27% for heavy users; and 10-14% for occasional users. Following onset of smoking (cigarette containing 15.8 or 33.8 mg THC), the maximum THC plasma concentration (84.3 and 162.2 ng/mL) is attained at about 8 minutes and within 3-4 hours, falls rapidly to 1-4 ng/mL (35).When compared to smoking and inhalation, systemic absorption following oral ingestion was slower, with maximum plasma concentration (4.4-11 ng/mL for 20 mg; and 2.7-6.3 ng/mL for 15 mg) of THC attained in 1-2 hours.  Substantial metabolism in the liver, via microsomal hydroxylation and oxidation catalyzed by enzymes of cytochrome P450 complex, likely lowers oral bioavailability of THC by 4-12%.Much of the cannabis (80-90%) is excreted within 5 days in the form of hydroxylated and carboxylated metabolites (more than 65% of cannabis is excreted in the feces, with about 20% in urine). It is also important to note that residual THC levels have a half-life of 1.3 days in infrequent users compared to 5-13 days in frequent users (36).Data on cannabidiol indicate the half-life to be between 1.4 and 10.9 h following oromucosal spray; 2–5 days following chronic oral administration; 24 h following intravenous administration; and 31 h following smoking. Bioavailability after smoking was 31%, but has yet to be determined with other routes. The maximum concentration is reached much faster following smoking and inhalation compared to oral and oromucosal routes. The Tmax has been reported to be achieved between 0 and 4 h (37).",Seed(s),"Marijuana | Ganja | Bhang | Weed | Pot | Grass | Dope | Reefer | Hash | (>1000 other terms) | Anashca, Banji, Bhang, Blunt, Bud, Cannabis, Cannabis sativa, Charas, Dope, Esrar, Gaga, Ganga, Grass, Haschisch, Hash, Hashish, Herbe, Huo Ma Ren, Joint, Kif, Marie-Jeanne, Mariguana, Marihuana, Marijuana, Marijuana Médicale, Mary Jane, Medical Cannabis, Medical Marijuana, Pot, Sawi, Sinsemilla, Weed.",Cannabis Sativa seed,Cannabis,Cannabis,Cannabis

DSI002051,Lessertia frutescens,C1013055,"Sutherlandia frutescens is a shrub native to South Africa and the coast of West Africa. This plant and its related species have been used in traditional medicine to treat diabetes, chicken pox, external wounds, and cancer. Although Sutherlandia is not generally consumed as a dietary supplement in the West, some use the raw herb as an adaptogen. Constituents in Sutherlandia have antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer properties . A few case reports suggest it may help decrease fatigue in cancer patients , but whether it could be used as a treatment for cancer has not been studied in humans. Due to limited access to pharmaceuticals, an effort in Africa to promote local herbs to treat AIDS has included Sutherlandia . However in a double-blind safety trial in adults with HIV, patients randomized to S. frutescens did not have changes in viral load or CD4 T-lymphocyte count, but did have longer duration of secondary infection . Adverse effects are rare but Sutherlandia may interact with CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein substrate drugs, and particularly drugs used to treat AIDS or prevent tuberculosis .",,"In vitro studies suggest Sutherlandia has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects (9). The constituent pinitol demonstrated antidiabetic effects by increasing availability of glucose for cell metabolism (2). Sutherlandia upregulated VAMP3, a gene which plays a role in vesicle transport, and also regulated 26 other genes that code for vesicle transporters, receptors, signalling molecules, transcription factors, and metabolic enzymes (14). GABA found in the dry leaves of this herb can slow down nerve cell activity (2).
An ethanolic extract of Sutherlandia inhibited growth of MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells by inducing apoptosis (10) (11). Sutherlandia also downregulated metalloproteinases that control cell migration, proliferation, and apoptosis, and regulate tumor expansion, angiogenesis, and dissemination (10).","Leaf |

Fluoride protects teeth from the bacteria in plaque. It also promotes new bone formation. This is different than most medicines used for weak bones (osteoporosis), which fight osteoporosis by keeping bone from being broken down. People commonly use fluoride to prevent cavities. It is also used for tooth plaque, a mild form of gum disease (gingivitis), osteoporosis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of its other uses. The FDA warns that swallowing too much toothpaste can increase the risk for tooth staining. But this is likely more of a concern with long-term use rather than accidentally swallowing it just once. Also, starting June 2022, fluoride levels in bottled water cannot exceed 0.7 mg per liter and must be declared on the label.","When taken by mouth : Fluoride is commonly consumed in public drinking water. It is likely safe when consumed in doses below the tolerable upper intake level (UL) of 10 mg of elemental fluoride daily. Taking high doses, long-term can weaken bones and ligaments, and cause muscle weakness and nervous system problems. When applied to the teeth : Fluoride is likely safe when used in toothpastes and mouthwashes, and when applied by dentists. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Fluoride is commonly consumed in public drinking water. It is likely safe when consumed in doses below the upper tolerable intake level of 10 mg daily and when applied directly to the teeth in toothpastes and mouthwashes while pregnant or breast-feeding. But using higher doses is possibly unsafe and can weaken bones and ligaments, and cause muscle weakness and nervous system problems. Children : Fluoride is commonly consumed in public water supplies. It is likely safe when consumed in doses below the daily upper tolerable intake level. These doses are set by age: 0.7 mg for 0-6 months, 0.9 mg for 7-12 months, 1.3 mg for 1-3 years, 2.2 mg for 4-8 years, and 10 mg for children 8 years and older. It is also likely safe when applied directly to the teeth in toothpastes and mouthwashes. But consuming higher amounts of fluoride is possibly unsafe. Children under six should only use a pea-sized amount of fluoride-containing toothpaste, just in case they swallow some.

The root extracts are used in Germany for treating respiratory infections . Patients take supplemental forms to treat common cold and acute bronchitis. In vitro studies indicate that P. sidoides has antibacterial , antiviral , immunomodulatory , and anti-adhesive properties. Data from clinical trials suggest effectiveness against acute bronchitis and against rhinosinusitis . Meta-analyses suggest a significant decrease in bronchitis symptoms with P. sidoides use and benefit in pediatric respiratory tract infections . An herbal preparation from P. sidoides root was found effective for moderate to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) .",,"Polyphenols (eg, catechin) and 7-hydroxy-coumarins (eg, umckalin), the main constituents, have antimicrobial and immunomodulatory effects (1). Other constituents include polymeric proanthocyanidins, monomeric flavan-3-ols, phenolic acids, and gallic acid as well as small amounts of quercetin and sitosterol-glucoside (5).
P. sidoides extract increased natural killer cell formation, tumor necrosis factor alpha, iNO, and interferon-beta release, and also demonstrated anti-adhesive effects (5). In addition, the extract improved peripheral blood phagocytes by enhancing oxidative burst and intracellular killing in vitro (11). Anti-HIV effects may occur through inhibiting the attachment of viral particles to target cells (17).",Root extract,EPs 7630,Pelargonium sidoides,,Pelargonium sidoides,

DSI002212,Fucoidan,,"Fucoidan is a sulfated polysaccharide found in the cell walls of many species of brown seaweed. In vitro studies show that it has antitumor, antiangiogenic , antiviral , antiarthritic , and immunomodulatory effects. Fucoidan also exhibited neuroprotective , radioprotective , and antiulcer properties. In animal models, fucoidan exerts anti-inflammatory effects to protect against various organ injuries and improved inflammatory pathology of acute colitis . Although a high molecular weight fucoidan did not improve outcomes in mice following intracerebral hemorrhage, it is suggested that low-molecular-weight fucoidans have increased therapeutic potential and should be evaluated for this purpose . In humans, dietary fucoidan modulates platelet aggregation via anti-thrombotic effects . In overweight or obese adults, fucoidan over 3 months decreased diastolic blood pressure and LDL cholesterol, and increased insulin secretion . Fucoidan also decreased pro-viral load in a small group of patients with human T-lymphotropic virus type-1-associated neurological disease . Fucoisan consumption for one month prior to influenza vaccination may boost post-vaccination antibody production in immune-compromised elderly . Preclinical data suggest that fucoidan can help relieve cyclophosphamide-induced intestinal mucosal injury by altering gut flora, resulting in reduced inflammation . Oral fucoidan in a small group of volunteers improved mobilization of hematopoietic progenitor stem cells with high levels of CXCR4 expression . In advanced cancer patients, fucoidan coadministration enabled patients to continue chemotherapy, regulated fatigue , and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines . Because fucoidan demonstrates anticoagulant and antithrombotic activities, it may have additive effects when taken with anticoagulants. In a small study of breast cancer patients, co-administration of fucoidan with either of two hormonal therapies, letrozole or tamoxifen, was well tolerated and did not result in any clinically significant interactions .",,"In vitro, a low-molecular-weight fucoidan inhibited human rheumatoid arthritis fibroblast synoviocytes and triggered apoptosis via decreased expression and secretion of MMP-1, -3, and -9, and suppression of NF-kB binding activity, p65 nuclear translocation, and IkappaB-alpha degradation (18). In animal models, fucoidan protected against liver injury via suppression of the inflammatory signaling pathway, inflammatory mediators, and inflammatory cell infiltration (20). It also reduced production of cyclooygenase-2 and NO, while increasing expression of the hepatoprotective enzyme hemeoxygenase-1 on murine liver and HepG2 cells (21). Fucoidan suppressed inflammation in an ultraviolet B-irradiated mouse model, decreasing thickness of the prickle cell layer and MMP-1 (19).
In humans, dietary fucoidan shortens lysis time of the thrombus by elevating prostacyclin secretion caused by increased H2O2 production in the blood (24). Various antitumor, antiviral and immune-modulating effects are attributed to NK cell stimulation, and downregulation of transcription factor AP-I and IGF-IR signaling (2) (3) (32). In melanoma cells, it increased lapatinib effects via ERBB3 inhibition (33). In human colorectal cells, it reduced tumor-promoting M2 macrophages and in combination with etoposide, prevented HCT116 tumorigenicity (34). Neuroprotective effects are attributed to suppression of TNF-alpha- and IFNγ-induced NO production in C6 glioma cells (11) and to antioxidative effects (12). Fucoidan inhibits metastasis by preventing adhesion of tumor cells to the extracellular matrix (4). It induced apoptosis of human T-cell leukemia virus type I that causes adult T-cell leukemia by inactivating NF-kB, which regulates antiapoptotic proteins (3). In a murine model, fucoidan suppressed angiogenesis induced by sarcoma 180 cells (5).",Undaria pinnatifida -  whole plant | Several species of brown seaweed,Sulfated alpha-L-fucan | Fucoidin | Fucan | Mekabu fucoidan,Fucoidan,Fucoidan,Fucoidan,

People use gelatin for aging skin, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, brittle nails, obesity, diarrhea, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse gelatin with collagen type I (native), collagen type II (native), or collagen peptides. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : Gelatin is commonly consumed in foods. It is possibly safe when used in larger amounts as medicine, short-term. But taking high doses of 15 grams daily might increase the risk for side effects, including sore throat, swollen gums, and mouth sores. Gelatin comes from animals. This has led to some concern about contamination from sick animals. But there haven't been any reports of people getting sick after using gelatin products made from animals. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Gelatin is commonly consumed in foods. It is possibly safe to use colla corii asini, a specific type of gelatin made from donkey hide, in larger amounts as medicine. There isn't enough reliable information to know if other kinds of gelatin are safe to use as medicine when pregnant. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts. Breast-feeding : Gelatin is commonly consumed in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if gelatin is safe to use in larger amounts as medicine when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts. Children : A specific type of gelatin, called gelatin tannate, is possibly safe when taken by mouth as medicine for up to 5 days. In children under 3 years old or that weigh less than 15 kg (33 lbs), taking 250 mg of gelatin tannate four times daily for up to 5 days seems to be safe. In children over 3 years old or that weigh more than 15 kg, taking 500 mg of gelatin tannate four times daily for up to 5 days seems to be safe.",,,"Colla Corii Asini, Denatured Collagen, Ejiao, Gelatina, Gelatine, Gélatine, Partially Hydrolyzed Collagen.",Gelatin | Gelatin powder,Gelatin,,Gelatin

DSI002299,Arnica,C0052387,"Arnica is a perennial herb found in East Asia, Europe, the northern United States, and Canada. Its medicinal history dates back several centuries and arnica continues to be popular today. Its flowers and roots have been used to treat bruises, sprains, arthritic pain, and muscle aches. A highly diluted form of arnica is also used in homeopathic remedies. In vitro studies show that arnica has antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties. A few clinical trials suggest that topical arnica is helpful for osteoarthritis , and significantly reduces bruising compared with placebo or low-concentration vitamin K ointments . However, a small study reported that topical arnica actually increased pain 24 hours after calf exercises . Studies on postoperative benefits from use of arnica are mixed. It reduced swelling in patients following knee surgery , reduced pain following tonsillectomy , and may reduce bruising from rhinoplasty , but was not helpful after blepharoplasty . A recent meta-analysis of homeopathic arnica for postoperative recovery suggests a small effect size for preventing excess bruising and related sequelae . Rigorous research is needed to determine the clinical benefits of homeopathic arnica. | Arnica is an herb sometimes used to flavor foods. It can be poisonous when consumed in larger amounts. Arnica gel can be applied to the skin for osteoarthritis. The active chemicals in arnica may reduce swelling, decrease pain, and act as antibiotics. But arnica can be unsafe when taken by mouth unless it's used in homeopathic dilutions. Homeopathic products contain extreme dilutions of the active chemicals. People most commonly use arnica for pain caused by osteoarthritis. It is also used for bleeding, bruising, swelling after surgery, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Arnica is also used as a flavor ingredient in beverages, candy, baked goods, and other foods.","When taken by mouth : Homeopathic arnica is possibly safe. Homeopathic products often contain no active ingredient, so side effects are unlikely. It is also possibly safe to take arnica in the amounts found in food. But the Canadian government is concerned enough about its safety to prohibit its use in food. Taking arnica in amounts more than what is found in food is likely unsafe. In fact, arnica is considered poisonous. When taken by mouth it can cause vomiting, heart damage, organ failure, increased bleeding, coma, and death. When applied to the skin : Arnica is possibly safe when applied to unbroken skin, short-term. But it is likely unsafe to apply arnica to broken skin because it can be absorbed into the body. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Don't take arnica by mouth or apply it to the skin if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. It is considered likely unsafe. Allergy to ragweed and related plants : Arnica may cause an allergic reaction in people who are sensitive to the Asteraceae/Compositae family. Members of this family include ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many others. If you have allergies, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before applying arnica to your skin. Do not take arnica by mouth. Surgery : Arnica might cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using it at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Sesquiterpene lactones, the active constituents in arnica, have anti-inflammatory properties and inhibit binding of transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB to DNA (14). A tincture prepared from arnica flowers suppressed collagenase-1 (MMP1) and interstitial collagenase-13 (MMP13) mRNA levels in human articular chondrocytes in vitro (14). MMP13 and MMP1 enzymes are thought to play a significant role in cartilage and joint destruction and inflammation seen in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Both arnica tinctures and sesquiterpene lactones were found to suppress NF-κB activation and IL-12 production in dendritic cells at high concentrations, but can also have immunostimulatory effects when diluted (2). Another study found that sesquiterpene lactones inhibit platelet function by interacting with platelet sulfhydryl groups, probably associated with reduced phospholipase A2 activity (12). In addition to sesquiterpene lactones, the allergenic potential of arnica may be partly due to other allergens such as polyacetylenes (15).",Dried underground parts,"Mountain tobacco | Leopard's bane | Wolf's bane | Mountain arnica | American Arnica, Arctic Arnica, Arnica angustifolia, Arnica chamissonis, Arnica cordifolia, Arnica des Montagnes, Arnica Flos, Arnica Flower, Arnica fulgens, Arnica latifolia, Arnica montana, Arnica sororia, Arnikablüten, Bergwohlverleih, Doronic d'Allemagne, European Arnica, Fleurs d'Arnica, Foothill Arnica, Heart-Leaf Arnica, Herbe aux Chutes, Herbe aux Prêcheurs, Hillside Arnica, Kraftwurz, Leopard's Bane, Mountain Arnica, Mountain Snuff, Mountain Tobacco, North American Meadow Arnica, Plantin des Alpes, Quinquina des Pauvres, Souci des Alpes, Tabac des Savoyards, Tabac des Vosges, Twin Arnica, Wolf's Bane, Wolfsbane, Wundkraut.",Arnica,Arnica | Arnica (unspecified) | Hairy Arnica,Arnica,Arnica

DSI002302,Symphytum,C1621344,"Comfrey is a fast-growing plant whose leaves and roots have been used historically for wound healing and other conditions. Preclinical studies suggest that oral comfrey has antiproliferative effects , and a topical formulation showed wound healing properties . Studies in humans are very limited. Although preliminary data on topical formulations suggest it may relieve pain , a Cochrane Review of herbal medicine for low back pain did not find sufficient evidence for its use . Comfrey contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are hepatotoxic, mutagenic, and carcinogenic , and hepatotoxicity with oral use of comfrey has been cited in the medical literature . In addition, misidentification with foxglove has led to several cases of accidental ingestion of what was thought to be comfrey herbal tea, resulting in cardiac glycoside poisonings . Comfrey was used since the 1930s for animal feed, but has been prohibited in Australia and New Zealand. In June 2001, the FDA asked all manufacturers to remove products containing comfrey from the market . | Comfrey (Symphytum officinale) is a plant with yellow or purple flowers found in Europe, Asia, and North America. It contains chemicals that are poisonous. Comfrey contains chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), which can cause severe liver damage. It also contains chemicals that might reduce swelling. Despite safety concerns, some people use comfrey for bruises, osteoarthritis, sprains, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. The US FDA has recommended that all comfrey products that are taken by mouth be removed from the market due to serious safety concerns. Don't confuse comfrey with black root or bugle. These are not the same. Also don't confuse it with foxglove, which looks similar to comfrey before it blooms.","When taken by mouth : Comfrey is likely unsafe. It contains chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), which can cause liver damage, lung damage, and cancer. The FDA has recommended that all comfrey products that are taken by mouth be removed from the market. When applied to the skin : Comfrey is possibly safe when used on unbroken skin in small amounts for less than 6 weeks. But the poisonous chemicals in comfrey can pass through the skin, so it is possibly unsafe to use comfrey on broken skin or to apply large amounts for more than 6 weeks. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Comfrey is likely unsafe when taken by mouth or applied to the skin while pregnant or breast-feeding. The PAs in comfrey are absorbed through the skin and might cause birth defects. Avoid use. Broken or damaged skin : Don't apply comfrey to broken or damaged skin. Doing so might expose you to large amounts of the chemicals in comfrey that can cause liver damage and other serious health effects. Liver disease : Comfrey might make liver disease worse. Don't use comfrey if you have any liver problems.","Preclinical studies suggest allantoin and rosmarinic acid compounds in comfrey may be responsible for cell proliferation and anti-inflammatory effects (20). Comfrey was also shown to stimulate granulation and tissue regeneration, and support callus formation (19).
Although systemic absorption following use of topical comfrey preparations is not known, an evaluation in human skin samples suggests there may be an overestimation of risk for pyrrolizidine alkaloid absorption (25).",Fresh underground parts,"Slippery root | Knitbone | Blackwort | Bruisewort | Ass Ear, Black Root, Blackwort, Bruisewort, Common Comfrey, Consolidae Radix, Consound, Consoude, Consoude Officinale, Consuelda, Grande Consoude, Gum Plant, Healing Herb, Herbe aux Charpentiers, Herbe à la Coupure, Knitback, Knitbone, Langue-de-Vache, Oreille d'Âne, Salsify, Slippery Root, Symphytum officinale, Wallwort.",Symphytum,Comfrey,Comfrey,Comfrey

It is also used for stomach ulcers, athletic performance, kidney damage, dental plaque, tooth discoloration, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Sodium bicarbonate is likely safe when used appropriately, short-term. Over-the-counter antacid products containing sodium bicarbonate are considered safe and effective by the US FDA. Taking sodium bicarbonate in very high doses is possibly unsafe. It is also possibly unsafe to take sodium bicarbonate that it is not fully dissolved into a solution. Stomach rupture and serious changes in electrolyte levels have occurred. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if sodium bicarbonate is safe to use or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Sodium bicarbonate is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. There is some concern that it might increase the risk of water retention or pH imbalances in the tissues. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if sodium bicarbonate is safe to use while breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : There isn't enough reliable information to know if sodium bicarbonate is safe to use by mouth in children. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Sodium bicarbonate is possibly unsafe when applied to the skin. There have been reports of high sodium blood levels in children following use. Burns : Applying sodium bicarbonate to burns might increase burn thickness in the skin. Sudden loss of heart function (cardiac arrest) : Sodium bicarbonate doesn't seem to help in people who have had cardiac arrest. It might reduce survival or slow down recovery. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) : Sodium bicarbonate increases blood acids called ketones, which are associated with DKA. Sodium bicarbonate should not be used in people with this condition. Swelling (edema) : Because sodium bicarbonate contains sodium, it can increase the risk of swelling caused by excess fluids in the body. People with heart failure, liver disease, or other conditions associated with fluid build-up should use sodium bicarbonate with caution. High calcium levels in the blood : People with high calcium levels in the blood can have trouble getting rid of bicarbonate. Taking sodium bicarbonate might increase the risk of complications such as milk-alkali syndrome. High sodium levels in the blood : Sodium bicarbonate might increase sodium levels in the blood. People who already have high levels of sodium in the blood should avoid sodium bicarbonate. High blood pressure : Sodium bicarbonate might increase blood pressure. People who already have high blood pressure should avoid sodium bicarbonate. Low potassium levels in the blood : Sodium bicarbonate might lower potassium blood levels. People who already have low levels of potassium should avoid sodium bicarbonate.",,Sodium bicarbonate,"Baking Soda, Bicarbonate of Soda, Bread Soda, Cooking Soda, Sodium Hydrogen Carbonate.",Sodium hydrogen carbonate | Sodium bicarbonate,Sodium Bicarbonate,,Sodium Bicarbonate

DSI002365,Boswellia,C2608032,"Boswellia serrata is a tree prevalent in India, the Middle East and North Africa. The gummy exudate or resin obtained by peeling away the bark is commonly known as frankincense or olibanum. Boswellia is used widely in Ayurveda for treating arthritis, ulcerative colitis, coughs, sores, wound healing, and asthma. It is also available in supplemental forms to support joint health. The bioactive compound in boswellia is boswellic acid , a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. It showed anti-inflammatory, anti-arthritic , cytotoxic and radio-enhancing effects , and prevented intestinal tumorigenesis in a murine model . Other animal studies suggest boswellia may improve cognitive impairment and insulin resistance ; and essential oil of boswellia demonstrated antimicrobial property . In clinical studies, boswellia extracts ; a formulation containing boswellia, Terminalia chebula and turmeric ; as well as boswellic acid combined with curcumin were all reported useful in patients with osteoarthritis although data are conflicting . Supplements containing boswellia were also reported useful for alleviating symptoms of tendinopathy , were comparable to acetaminophen in reducing musculoskeletal pain , and reduced aromatase inhibitor-induced joint pain . Additional studies suggest benefits in patients with oral aphthous lesions , bronchial asthma , ulcerative colitis , mild irritable bowel syndrome , and osteo-muscular pain . Larger trials are needed to confirm these effects. As well, evidence is unclear or negative surrounding boswellia’s effectiveness against collagenous colitis , with no significant benefit in maintaining remission in patients with Crohn’s disease . Preliminary findings suggest that boswellia may be effective in reducing cerebral edema in patients with brain tumors following radio- and radiochemotherapy , and topical use prevented radiation-induced skin damage in breast cancer patients . Also, boswellia formulations helped reduce mammary density, a risk factor for breast cancer ; and decreased genitourinary pain in men with prostatitis-like symptoms . Although similar in many functions, boswellia should not be confused with guggul or myrrh. | Frankincense is a hardened gum-like material (resin) that comes from the trunk of the Boswellia tree. People use its oil on the skin and in aromatherapy. Frankincense oil seems to kill some types of bacteria and fungi (yeasts). It is commonly used as a fragrance in soaps, lotions, and perfumes. People use frankincense for aging skin, wound healing, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any use. There is also no good evidence to support using frankincense for COVID-19. Boswellia tree extracts are also sometimes taken by mouth. For information on taking frankincense by mouth, see Boswellia serrata.","When applied to the skin : Frankincense essential oil or gum extract is possibly safe. It might cause skin irritation in some people. When inhaled : Frankincense essential oil is possibly safe. There isn't enough reliable information to know what the side effects might be. For information on the safety of taking frankincense by mouth, see Boswellia serrata. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if frankincense is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.","Boswellic acid, the major constituent of boswellia, is thought to contribute to many of the herb’s pharmacological activities. Preclinical studies show that anti-inflammatory activity occurs via inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase (2) (3) and cyclooxygenase-1 (35). Boswellic acid also inhibits nuclear transcription factor KappaB (NF-KappaB) signaling, markedly decreasing production of the key proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) (17). Unlike other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, however, it failed to show analgesic or antipyretic effects (16).
Research on cytotoxic effects of boswellic acid indicates that it induces p21 expression through a p53-independent pathway and causes apoptosis in glioma (4) (6) and leukemia (5) cell lines. A boswellia extract induced apoptosis in a cervical cancer cells by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (18). Other apoptotic mechanisms include early generation of nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species that upregulated time-dependent expression of p53/p21/PUMA (19), inhibition of microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1), and decreased prostaglandin (PGE2) levels and its downstream targets (37).
A semisynthetic analog of boswellic acid, 3-alpha-Butyryloxy-beta-boswellic acid, demonstrated significant growth inhibition in Ehrlich Ascitic Tumour (EAT), Ehrlich Ascitic Carcinoma (EAC) and Sarcoma-180 tumor models, via NF-KappaB downregulation and induction of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage (27). Acetyl-boswellic acids inhibited topoisomerases by competing with DNA for binding sites (20). Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA) inhibited human prostate tumor growth via inhibition of VEGFR2-induced angiogenesis (22). The antiplatelet effects of boswellia gum resin extracts are attributed to inhibition of clotting factors Xa and XIa. (34).",Resin | Stem bark oleogum resin,"Indian frankincense | Arbre à Encens, Bible Frankincense, Boswellie, Encens, Incense, Kondor, Kundur, Oleo-gum-resin, Oléo-Gomme-Résine, Oliban, Olibanum, Ru Xiang, Ru Xiang Shu.",Boswellia Carterii | Boswellia,Boswellia | Frankincense,Boswellia,Frankincense

DSI002367,Vinpocetine,C0059752,"Vinpocetine is derived from vincamine, an alkaloid found in the common periwinkle plant. Originally developed in Europe where it is marketed as a drug called Cavinton, vinpocetine is sold in the United States as a dietary supplement to improve brain function. Animal models suggest that vinpocetine has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antimitotic, antiatherogenic, antithrombotic, and antiepileptic effects . Human studies suggest vinpocetine enhances short-term memory , cognitive performance , and improves chronic cerebral dysfunction in elderly patients . It has also been studied as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease , but a systematic review did not find benefit . In both healthy adult volunteers and patients with focal epilepsy, no significant cognitive benefits were seen with the vinpocetine dosages tested . Other small studies suggest vinpocetine may help maintain or improve hemorheologic parameters in patients with cerebrovascular disorders , but a systematic review did not find enough evidence for benefit in patients with acute ischemic stroke . In a randomized open-label study, intravenous vinpocetine adjunctive to treatment for acute cerebral infarction improved cerebral blood flow, neurological functioning, and cognition . Vinpocetine inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo . In animal studies, it potentiates the effects of radiation therapy in tumor cells . In nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients following radiation injury, preliminary data suggest potential with a combination of vinpocetine and dexamethasone for cognitive impairment compared with dexamethasone alone . However, studies in cancer patients in general are lacking. Vinpocetine should not be confused with chemotherapy drugs such as vincristine or vinblastine, which are also alkaloids derived from the periwinkle plant. | Vinpocetine is a man-made chemical similar to a substance found in the periwinkle plant (Vinca minor). In Europe, it's sold as a drug called Cavinton. Vinpocetine might increase blood flow to the brain and protect brain cells (neurons) against injury. People use vinpocetine for memory, dementia, stroke, hearing loss, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. In the US, vinpocetine is allowed to be included in dietary supplements, but its status is controversial and may change. The FDA has yet to make a final ruling. In 2019, the FDA issued a warning for those who are pregnant or may become pregnant to avoid vinpocetine due to safety concerns.","When taken by mouth : Vinpocetine is possibly safe for most people when used appropriately for up to one year. It can cause some side effects including anxiety, stomach discomfort, sleep problems, headache, dizziness, and flushing of the face. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Vinpocetine is possibly unsafe when used during pregnancy or by those who may become pregnant. Vinpocetine might increase the risk of miscarriage and might cause harm to the fetus. Avoid using. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if vinpocetine is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Bleeding disorders : Vinpocetine might increase the risk of bleeding. Use cautiously if you have a bleeding disorder. Weakened immune system : Vinpocetine might weaken the immune system in some people. This might reduce the body's ability to fight infections. If you already have a weakened immune system, check with your healthcare provider before using vinpocetine. Surgery : Vinpocetine might slow blood clotting. This might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using vinpocetine at least 2 weeks before you are scheduled for surgery.","Vinpocetine is a synthetic ethyl ester of apovincamine derived from an alkaloid in the common periwinkle plant (17). In vitro, antioxidant and hydroxyl radical scavenging properties have been observed (18) (13). Vinpocetine inhibits PDE1 activity and improves cerebral blood flow by elevating cGMP and cAMP, increasing mitochondrial function, and improving glucose and oxygen utilization by the brain. Vinpocetine helps improve spatial memory in rats by preventing neuronal damage and favorably modulating cholinergic function (18). Antiepileptic effects were attributed to suppression of abnormal neuronal excitability via sodium channel regulation and dopamine release in striatal nerve endings (5) (6) (7). Vinpocetine antagonizes platelet-derived growth factor-induced extracellular matrix synthesis, suppresses intracellular ROS production, and inhibits extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation and vascular smooth muscle cell growth (4). Antiatherogenic effects occur through inhibition of monocyte adhesion, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses mediated by protein kinase B/nuclear factor kappa B-dependent pathways (3). Vinpocetine also demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting TNF-α-induced NF-κB activities (19) as well as Akt and STAT3 activation (15). In a murine model of otitis media, vinpocetine suppressed S. pneumoniae-induced mucus production through mucin MUC5AC inhibition (27).
In vitro and in vivo studies indicate vinpocetine antitumor activity against human breast cancer cells occurs through G0/G1-phase cell cycle arrest and mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis (15). Vinpocetine may also increase the effects of radiation by increasing tumor oxygenation (16).
In humans, administration of vinpocetine to chronic stroke patients increased glucose uptake and release in unaffected areas of the brain (12). In a study of adjuvant vinpocetine, nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients had lower levels of serum inflammatory cytokines compared to those who received dexamethasone monotherapy (34).",Synthetic,"Vinpocetine | Periwinkle | Vinca minor | Kavinton; Cavinton | Rgh-4405 | Tcv-3B | Apovincaminic acid | AY-27255, Cavinton, Common Periwinkle Vinpocetine, Eburnamenine-14-carboxylic acid, Ethyl Apovincaminate, Ethylapovincaminoate, Lesser Periwinkle extract, RGH-4405, TCV-3b, Vinca minor extract, Vinpocetin, Vinpocetina, Vinpocétine.",Vinpocetine,Vinpocetine,Vinpocetine,Vinpocetine

Cola nut contains caffeine. Caffeine works by stimulating the central nervous system, heart, and muscles. People use cola nut for fatigue, depression, exhaustion, diarrhea, weight loss, migraine headaches, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse cola nut with a similar sounding plant called Gotu Kola. These are not the same. Also, don't confuse it with caffeine or other products that contain caffeine, including black tea, cocoa, coffee, green coffee, green tea, guarana, oolong tea, and yerba mate.","When taken by mouth : Cola nut is commonly consumed in foods. Cola nut is possibly safe when used as medicine for up to 12 weeks. Cola nut is possibly unsafe when used in large amounts or long-term. Chewing cola nut is linked to an increased risk for mouth cancer and stomach cancer. Consuming large amounts of cola nut might also cause side effects due to its caffeine content. These side effects can range from mild to serious and include headache and irregular heartbeat. Stick to caffeine doses under 400 mg daily to limit side effects. Suddenly stopping caffeine use can sometimes cause withdrawal symptoms, including headaches, anxiety, and dizziness. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Cola nut is possibly safe when consumed during pregnancy in amounts normally found in food. But larger amounts are possibly unsafe due to its caffeine content. Consuming more than 300 mg of caffeine daily has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage and other negative effects. Keep in mind that only the amount of ADDED caffeine must be stated on product labels. Caffeine found in ingredients such as cola nut, which naturally contains caffeine, does not need to be provided. This can make it difficult to determine the total amount of caffeine in a given product. Breast-feeding : Cola nut is possibly safe when consumed while breast-feeding in amounts normally found in food. But larger amounts are possibly unsafe due to its caffeine content. Caffeine passes into breast milk, so cola nut intake should be closely monitored to make sure it's on the low side. Caffeine from cola nut can cause sleep disturbances, irritability, and increased bowel activity in breast-fed infants. Anxiety disorders : The caffeine in cola nut might make anxiety disorders worse. Bleeding disorders : Cola nut contains caffeine, which might slow blood clotting. Use cola nut with care if you have a bleeding disorder. Heart conditions : The caffeine in cola nut can cause irregular heartbeat in certain people. Use cola nut with caution if you have a heart condition. Diabetes : Cola nut contains caffeine. Caffeine might affect the way the body uses sugar. Use with caution if you have diabetes. Diarrhea : Cola nut contains caffeine. Caffeine, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea. Epilepsy : Cola nut contains caffeine. High doses of caffeine might cause seizures or decrease the effects of drugs used to prevent seizures. If you have ever had a seizure, don't use high doses of caffeine or caffeine-containing supplements such as cola nut. Glaucoma : The caffeine in cola nut increases pressure inside the eye. The increase might occur within 30 minutes and persist for at least 90 minutes. High blood pressure : The caffeine in cola nut might increase blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. But this does not seem to be a major concern in people who use caffeine regularly. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) : Cola nut contains caffeine. Caffeine, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea and might worsen symptoms of IBS. Weak bones (osteoporosis) : Cola nut contains caffeine. Caffeine can increase the amount of calcium that is flushed out in the urine. If you have osteoporosis or low bone density, caffeine should be limited to less than 300 mg daily (approximately 2-3 cups of coffee).",,Seed(s),"Arbre à Cola, Arbre à Kola, Bissey Nut, Bissy Nut, Bitter Kola, Cola acuminata, Cola nitida, Guru Nut, Gworo, Kola Nut, Kolatier, Noix de Cola, Noix de Gourou, Noix de Kola, Noix du Kolatier, Noix de Soudan, Noix du Soudan, Nuez de Cola, Soudan Coffee, Sterculia acuminata, Sterculia nitida.",Cola Acuminata,Cola,,Cola Nut

DSI002390,Evening primrose oil,C0700602,"Derived from the plant Oenothera biennis, evening primrose oil is used for rheumatoid arthritis, premenstrual syndrome, eczema, fatigue, diabetic neuropathy, and mastalgia. The mucilaginous stem and leaf juices have been used as a poultice to treat minor bruises and wounds, and soothe skin inflammation . Evening primrose oil is thought to improve skin moisture and reduce transepidermal water loss . It is also among the popular natural products used to relieve menopausal symptoms . In vitro, evening primrose oil demonstrates anti-inflammatory activity and inhibits platelet aggregation . In animal models, it exerts anti-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-arthritic effects , and improved cardiac recovery after myocardial infarction . Human studies on whether evening primrose oil is helpful for skin conditions are limited and mixed. Small trials suggest benefit in atopic dermatitis , but other analyses did not find evening primrose oil or borage oil effective for eczema . In acne patients treated with oral isotretinoin, evening primrose oil may improve xerotic cheilitis . It may also reduce 5-azacitidine-induced skin reactions in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome . Other preliminary data suggest benefit in some lipid profiles , rheumatoid arthritis symptoms , ulcerative colitis , or for ocular surface diseases such as dry eye , but early studies in diabetic neuropathy were equivocal . More recently, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) derived from evening primrose oil was found noninferior to alpha-lipoic acid for reducing pain in patients with diabetic neuropathy . In multiple sclerosis patients, evening primrose oil may improve fatigue and quality of life , and along with hemp seed and a diet high in antioxidants, it may improve clinical and immunological parameters . Additional data indicate that supplementation with vitamin E and evening primrose oil reduced cyclical mastalgia , but other analyses did not find improvements in breast pain or premenstrual syndrome . Evening primrose oil may improve quality of life and decrease hot flash intensity in menopausal women , although other data suggest that behavioral/lifestyle approaches such as exercise provide better relief . In postmenopausal women, it improved related psychological symptoms , but more study is needed to confirm these effects. Studies in cancer patients are quite limited, with one trial involving liver cancer patients that showed no effect on tumor size or survival , and another that suggested GLA may be an effective adjunctive therapy for breast cancer . Although evening primrose oil does not have intrinsic estrogenic properties, some commercial products combine evening primrose oil with phytoestrogens. Therefore, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use evening primrose oil products with caution.",,"Evening primrose oil is rich in the omega-6 fatty acid GLA, which can be converted directly to the prostaglandin precursor dihomo-GLA (DGLA) (2) (3). Administration of the oil may benefit individuals unable to metabolize cis-linolenic acid to GLA, producing subsequent intermediates of metabolic significance including prostaglandins (2) (3).
In vitro, long-chain fatty alcohols such as hexacosanol, tetracosanol, docosanol, and octocosanol demontrated anti-inflammatory activity (29). In animal models, benefits on cardiac recovery after myocardial infarction were attributed to its hypocholesterolemic effect and indirect influence on prostaglandins and cytokine synthesis (31). In arthiritis models, evening primrose oil normalized body weight, angiopoietin-1, and TNF-alpha levels, and reduced malondialdehyde levels, synovial hyperplasia, and inflammatory cell invasion in joint tissues (30).
In patients with multiple sclerosis, evening primrose oil accelerates anti-inflammatory responses and prevents pro-inflammatory cytokine production while helping to maintain fatty acid membranes and optimizing balance between saturated and unsaturated fatty acids (40). Increases in plasma GLA and its metabolite DGLA seen with evening primrose oil supplementation has correlated with clinical improvements in atopic dermatitis (32) and produced dose-dependent effects on serum fatty acid levels and eczema severity scores (25). Inhibition of cheilitis is attributed to GLA’s effects on stratum corneum maturation, differentiation, and preservation of its permeability barrier (34). Antiplatelet and anticoagulant effects are likely related to decreased thromboxane B2 synthesis induced by evening primrose oil (46) (47).",Oenothera biennis - Seed,Evening primrose oil | Night willow herb | Fever plant | King's cure-all,Evening primrose oil | Evening Primrose Oil,evening primrose oil,Evening Primrose Oil,

It is also used to treat anorexia, gout, cancer and AIDS. Burdock showed anti-inflammatory , antibacterial , antiulcerogenic , hepatoprotective , antidiabetic and anticancer effects in preclinical studies. In small studies, topical use of a formula containing burdock improved dermal extracellular matrix metabolism and visibly reduced wrinkles . Oral intake of burdock tea improved inflammatory markers in patients with knee osteoarthritis and formulations containing burdock improved lipid metabolism and postprandial blood glucose in patients with diabetic nephropathy , may be useful against Helicobacter pylori infection and reduce the frequency and intensity of night sweats in postmenopausal women . Confirmatory studies are needed. A burdock tea was found contaminated with atropine, an alkaloid . Patients should be aware that poor quality control is a major concern with commercial herbal products.

The polyacetylenes and chlorogenic acid have antibacterial properties and are thought responsible for burdock’s beneficial effects against infections and skin disorders (11).
Arctigenin and arctiin, along with lignans matairesinol, (iso)lappaol A, lappaol C, and lappaol F were shown to up-regulate the expression of Jun-N-terminal kinase-1 (jnk-1), and promote longetivty and stress resistance in the round worm Caenorhabditis elegans via the JNK-1-DAF-16 cascade (15).
Animal studies indicate that burdock extract induces hypoglycemia and increases carbohydrate tolerance, stimulates uterine smooth muscle, and has antimutagenic activity. The tannin extract induces macrophage response (8). Burdock also exhibits hepatoprotective effects in rats due to its antioxidative activity (6).
Further, Lappaol F was shown to induce G(1) and G(2) cell-cycle arrest, induce cell death in several cancer cell lines, and to activate caspases (16). In other studies, arctigenin inhibited the proliferation, and induced caspase-3-dependent apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells via suppression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/nitric oxide (NO)/signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3)/survivin signalling pathway (17).",Root | Root,"Lappa | Wild gobo | Happy major | Niubang | Arctium, Arctium lappa, Arctium minus, Arctium tomentosum, Bardana, Bardana-minor, Bardanae Radix, Bardane, Bardane Comestible, Bardane Géante, Bardane Majeure, Beggar's Buttons, Burdock Root Extract, Burr Seed, Clotbur, Cocklebur, Cockle Buttons, Edible Burdock, Fox's Clote, Gobo, Glouteron, Grande Bardane, Great Bur, Great Burdocks, Happy Major, Hardock, Harebur, Herbe aux Teigneux, Herbe du Teigneux, Lappa, Love Leaves, Niubang, Niu Bang Zi, Orelha-de-gigante, Personata, Philanthropium, Rhubarbe du Diable, Thorny Burr.",Arctium Lappa | Arctium pubens,Burdock,Burdock,Burdock

All parts of the tree, especially the fruit, are commonly used in traditional medicine for various ailments including diarrhea, jaundice, headaches, inflammation, and as a tonic . It is also a constituent of the popular Ayurvedic formulation, Triphala. The activity of E. officinalis is often attributed to its antioxidant constituents, such as ascorbic acid, polyphenols, flavonoids, and tannins . Preclinical studies indicate antioxidant , antibacterial , hepatoprotective , cardioprotective radioprotective , antiulcerogenic , antitumor , analgesic , antidiabetic and antihyperlipidemic properties. Limited clinical data suggest benefits in patients with uremia by reducing oxidative stress , for improving HDL and lowering LDL-cholesterol levels in diabetic patients , and for lowering lipid levels and blood pressure in patients with hyperlipidemia , but ineffective in reducing hypertension . Supplementation with an E. officinalis extract was shown to lower multiple risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease in overweight adults , and as an adjunct, useful in the management of metabolic syndrome . It was also found to benefit those with non-erosive reflux disease , and helped reduce inflammation and periodontal destruction in patients with chronic periodontitis . Because E. officinalis exhibits strong antioxidant effects, it may interfere with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.",,"The antioxidant activity of E. officinalis is attributed to the high content of ascorbic acid (4), but it was reported that such effects may be due to the tannins, Emblicanin A and Emblicanin B (1). The antidiabetic property is thought to be due to the herb’s ability to reduce release of inflammatory cytokines that cause insulin resistance (12). E. officinalis may also play a role in preventing age-related hyperlipidemia by reducing nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) protein levels via inhibiting NF-kappa B activation (13). In another study, the herb extracts were shown to induce apoptosis in mature osteoclasts, an effect that may limit bone resorption in pathologies associated with bone loss (15). And a hydroalcoholic extract of E. officinalis demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by increasing glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities, and subsequently decreasing lipid peroxidation (19).
Several studies have also investigated the antitumor properties of E. officinalis. Pyrogallol, a component of E. officinalis extract, was found to cause cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, inhibit proliferation, and induce apoptosis in human lung adenocarcinoma (H441) and squamous cell cancer (H520) cell lines (2). Intraperitoneal pyrogallol injections also suppressed subcutaneous tumor growth in mice (2). An aqueous extract decreased tumor volume through inhibiting the cell cycle regulating enzyme CDC25 (10). Progallin, extracted from E. officinalis leaves, also caused cell cycle arrest in the G1/M and G2/M phase, inhibited proliferation, and induce apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (BEL-7404) (14). In other studies, E. officinalis extracts were shown to inhibit cell growth both in vitro and in vivo possibly via inhibition of angiogenesis and activation of autophagy in ovarian cancer cells (20); and demonstrated cardioprotective effects against doxorubicin toxicity in vitro (3), which was attributed to antioxidants.",Fruit,Gooseberry | amla | amalaka | amalaki,Emblica officinalis,,Emblica officinalis,

DSI002549,Rhamnus purshiana,C3486388,"Cascara sagrada is a species of buckthorn plant native to North America. The bark of the plant has been used to relieve constipation and is marketed as a dietary supplement. It is also used as an ingredient in the Hoxsey herbal formula, an ineffective alternative cancer treatment. The major constituents are cascarosides that stimulate the large intestine and produce a laxative effect. In vitro studies suggest that emodin, one of the constituents, has hepatoprotective , neuroprotective , anti-osteoporotic , and chemopreventive effects . Emodin also enhances the cytotoxic effects of some chemotherapeutic agents . However, human studies have not been conducted to confirm these effects. Prolonged use or overdose of cascara can cause diarrhea, electrolyte imbalance, and hepatitis .",,"Cascarosides stimulate the large intestine, increasing intestinal motility and contractions to produce a well-documented laxative effect. Increased water and electrolyte content in the lumen also results, which further facilitates bowel passage. The constituent emodin has direct excitatory effect on circular smooth muscle cells in the large intestine (9).
Emodin may play a protective role against osteoporosis. It was shown to suppress the receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation of bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), and the bone resorption of mature osteoclasts via inhibiting expression of RANKL-induced NF-κB, c-Fos, and NFATc1 (21).
In vitro studies suggest anticancer properties, as aloe-emodin induces p53 and p21 expression that results in G1-phase cell cycle arrest (8). However, more studies are needed to confirm such effects. Studies on the carcinogenic effects of cascara have produced conflicting results (4) (5) (6) (10).",Aged root | Food flavoring agent,Cascara sagrada | Sacred bark,Rhamnus purshiana,Cascara,Cascara,

DSI002555,Borago,C0522464,"Borage oil, derived from the seeds of the plant, is a rich source of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA) and linoleic acid (LA). In herbal and traditional medicine, borage oil has been used to induce sweating, as an expectorant and anti-inflammatory, to promote lactation, to stimulate adrenal function, and as an alternative source to evening primrose oil for obtaining GLA . It has also been promoted to treat rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis, diabetic neuropathy, menopause-related symptoms, and gastrointestinal disease . Preclinical studies suggest antimutagenic, cytotoxic, and chemopreventive effects . In an animal model of senile osteoporosis, a diet rich in borage or fish oils reduced inflammation and improved bone parameters . Borage extract consumption improved markers of disease-induced cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer’s models . In humans, studies suggest that GLA from borage seed oil has some benefits in treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) . A long-term study of fish and borage seed oils either alone or in combination suggest these may be useful to correct dyslipidemia in RA patients at increased risk for cardiovascular disease . Other analyses suggest moderate evidence of GLA-containing oils for relief of RA pain and disability without increased adverse events, but dose and treatment duration are unknown and there was not enough evidence to support their current use in RA management . In a preliminary double-blind trial, a borage extract improved clinical findings of moderate asthma, but not related inflammation . In patients with mild asthma, a combination of seed oils from borage and echium, a plant rich in LA, produced anti-inflammatory effects . In patients with early type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome, this combination also lowered total and LDL cholesterol levels . In a study of postmenopausal hypertensive women, short-term borage oil supplementation significantly reduced blood pressure and waist-to-hip ratio . Studies are mixed on whether borage oil can help skin conditions such as atopic eczema and several analyses indicate that neither evening primrose nor borage oil are effective for this purpose, with improvements being similar to respective placebos . Borage oil contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that are hepatotoxic . Risk of hepatic damage increases with length of exposure and cumulative dose consumed. Patients should use borage oil certified free of unsaturated pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Borage should not be used during pregnancy or when breastfeeding . | Borage (Borago officinalis) is an herb. Borage seed oil contains a fatty acid called gamma-linolenic acid, which seems to have anti-inflammatory effects. Borage is native to the Middle East, Mediterranean, and North Africa. Borage plant parts other than the seed oil can contain dangerous chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). Borage seed oil doesn't contain this chemical. People use borage seed oil for many conditions, including eczema, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), diabetes, and infant development, but there is no good scientific  evidence to support most of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Borage seed oil is possibly safe when used for up to 12 weeks. Other parts of the borage plant, such as the flower, leaf, and seed, may be unsafe. These parts of the plant can contain dangerous chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). PAs can damage the liver or cause cancer, especially when used in high doses or for a long time. Only use products that are certified and labeled as PA-free. When applied to the skin : Borage seed oil is possibly safe. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Borage products containing dangerous chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are likely unsafe during pregnancy and while breast-feeding. These chemicals can cause serious liver disease and might cause cancer. PAs might also cause birth defects and can pass into breast milk. It is important to avoid borage products that might contain PAs. Only use products that are certified and labeled as PA-free. Children : Borage seed oil is possibly safe when taken by mouth. Borage products that contain PAs are likely unsafe when taken by mouth. Only use products that are certified and labeled as PA-free. Bleeding disorders : Borage seed oil might prolong bleeding time and increase the risk of bruising and bleeding. If you have a bleeding disorder, use borage with caution. Liver disease : Borage products containing pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PA) might make liver disease worse. Borage seed oil doesn't contain these chemicals. But other parts of the plant, like the leaf, flower, and seed, can contain PAs. Only use products that are certified and labeled as PA-free. Surgery : Borage seed oil might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop taking borage seed oil at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Anti-inflammatory properties of borage oil have been attributed to its high GLA content (16). It also contains other fatty acids including linoleic, oleic, palmitic, stearic, eicosenoic, and erucic acids (28). GLA can be converted to the prostaglandin precursor dihomo-gama-linolenic acid. DGLA can block transformation of arachidonic acid to leukotrienes and other prostaglandins (10). GLA can increase cAMP levels which suppress synthesis of TNF-alpha, an inflammatory mediator linked to rheumatoid arthritis (9). The mucilage constituent has an expectorant-like action and malic acid has a mild diuretic effect. The tannin constituent may have mild astringent and constipating actions (3).
In vitro, a borage oil formulation demonstrated inhibitory effects on alpha-amylase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes 1,4-alpha-glucoside bonds in oligo- and polysaccharides, the first step in digesting dietary starch and glycogen (29). In animal models, borage oil improved amyloid-beta-induced long-term potentiation disruption in the hippocampal dentate gyrus, providing a neuroprotective effect attributed to the scavenging of free radicals (18). Borage-enriched sunflower oil counteracted pro-inflammatory mechanisms and prevented senile osteoporosis by inhibiting osteoblast-induced osteoclast formation (17).
In human studies, dietary supplementation with borage and echium seed oils produced anti-inflammatory effects in mild asthmatics by altering polyunsaturated fatty acid levels and attenuating leukotriene production (24). Individual genetic variation in fatty acid desaturase as a gene–diet interaction has been proposed to explain heterogeneity of anti-inflammatory effects in clinical trials. One study demonstrated that borage oil elevated serum GLA and DGLA in an rs174537 genotype-dependent manner, and further suggests that “one size fits all” supplementation may not be appropriate (40).
Although aerial parts of borage demonstrate affinity for the serotonin transporter, toxicity profiles preclude its further development as an herbal drug (30). Borage contains several minor constituents known as pyrrolizidine alkaloids which are hepatotoxic, including amabiline, supinine, lycopsamine, intermedine, acetyllycopsamine and acetylintermedine (26) (31). Borage oil also has teratogenic effects, and its prostaglandin E agonist action may cause premature labor (9).",Seed(s),"Bee plant | Bee bread | Borage seed oil | Ox's tongue | Starflower oil | Bee Plant, Beebread, Borage Flower, Borage Leaf, Borage Oil, Borage Seed Oil, Borago, Borago officinalis, Borraja, Bourrache, Bourrache Commune, Burage, Burrage, Common Borage, Common Bugloss, Cool Tankard, Feuille de Bourrache, Fleur de Bourrache, Huile de Bourrache, Huile de Graines de Bourrache, Langue de Bœuf, Ox's Tongue, Pain-des-Abeilles, Starflower, Starflower Oil, Talewort.",Borago Officinalis Seed Oil,Borage,Borage,Borage

DSI002589,Cranberry,C2740793,"Cranberry is an evergreen shrub that is grown in North America and Europe. The processed fruit and juice, both rich in vitamin C, are widely consumed as food. The juice extract is marketed as a dietary supplement for urinary tract health and to prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs). It has also been used for oral and gastrointestinal infections, cardiovascular diseases, and to protect against cancer. In preclinical studies, cranberry juice extracts and constituents exhibited antibacterial , antimicrobial , antifungal , anti-inflammatory , antioxidant , and antiadherence properties. Studies on whether cranberry products can prevent UTIs have been conducted in various populations, but results are mixed. Cranberry extracts can help prevent UTIs in adults , children , prostate cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy , and patients following urostomy . In women undergoing pelvic floor surgery, cranberry prophylaxis had no beneficial effects against UTIs, although UTI prevalence overall was lower than expected . A large double-blind study of older adults with high-baseline UTI risk showed benefit , but another similar study reported negative findings . A subsequent analysis revealed increased costs with no meaningful reduction in UTI rates in a geriatric nursing home environment . Studies of cranberry juice for recurrent UTIs have also been mixed, with one study finding no benefit among college-aged women , and another observing significant reductions in UTI relapse in women over age 50 . Cranberry was not as effective or cost-effective as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in preventing UTIs in premenopausal women, but patients were less likely to develop antibiotic-resistant bacteria . In volunteers from different regions, anti-adhesion activity with cranberry powder was found to be dose-dependent . Overall, a systematic review determined that cranberry juice was more effective than capsules or tablets , but despite some support for recurrent UTI prophylaxis , there is not enough evidence to recommend cranberry juice for UTI prevention . In other studies, cranberry juice inhibited adhesion of H. pylori to human gastric mucosa , and regular consumption may suppress H. pylori infection , a major factor in peptic ulcer disease and gastric cancer. When used with standard treatment, cranberry juice helped eradicate H. pylori . It potential to prevent plaque formation and gum disease as well may be due to its anticolonizing and antiadhesion properties . Preclinical studies suggest antiproliferative effects against prostate , liver , lung , neuroblastoma , breast , ovarian , gastric , colon , esophageal , and oral cancer cells with cranberry extracts and proanthocyanidins. In humans however, cranberry juice did not lower oxidative status, suggesting a lack of protective effect against cancer or heart disease . Cranberry juice has high concentrations of oxalates, and should be avoided in patients at risk for kidney stones . Other data suggest it may be helpful in uncommon forms including struvite stones, which are associated with bladder infections . | Cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) is an evergreen shrub that grows in bogs in North America. It produces dark red fruits that contain salicylic acid. Chemicals in cranberries keep bacteria from sticking to the cells in the urinary tract. But they don't seem to be able to remove bacteria that are already stuck to these cells. This might explain why cranberry helps prevent urinary tract infections (UTIs), but doesn't help treat them. People commonly use cranberry to prevent UTIs. Cranberry is also used for kidney stones, enlarged prostate, the common cold, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse cranberry with cramp bark, lingonberry, or uva ursi. These are sometimes also called cranberry but they are not the same.","When taken by mouth : Cranberry is commonly consumed in foods. Cranberry juice and cranberry extracts are likely safe for most adults. Drinking too much cranberry juice might cause some side effects such as mild stomach upset and diarrhea in some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Cranberry is commonly consumed in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if cranberry is safe to use in larger amounts when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts. Children : Cranberry is commonly consumed in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if cranberry is safe to use as medicine or what the side effects might be. Aspirin allergy : Cranberries contain significant amounts of salicylic acid. Salicylic acid is similar to aspirin. Avoid drinking large quantities of cranberry juice if you are allergic to aspirin. Diabetes : Some cranberry juice products are sweetened with extra sugar. If you have diabetes, stick with cranberry products that are sweetened with artificial sweeteners. Kidney stones : Cranberry juice and cranberry extracts contain a large amount of a chemical called oxalate. Since oxalate is found in kidney stones, cranberry might increase the risk of kidney stones. If you have a history of kidney stones, stay on the safe side and avoid taking cranberry extract products or drinking a lot of cranberry juice.","The A-type linkages in cranberry proanthocyanidins (C-PACs) may enhance urinary bacterial antiadhesion activities to prevent UTIs (25) (26) (27) (28) (64). Similarly, bioactivity against C. albicans biofilm formation is due to anti-adherence properties and/or iron chelation (46). In susceptible populations, improved preventive effects with cranberry juice over capsules or tablets may be related to better hydration with liquid, and/or additive effects with additional compounds in juice not contained in supplements (56). Anti-adhesion properties were also demonstrated in other microenvironments. Cranberry prevented H. pylori-induced stomach ulcers by inhibiting bacterial adhesions in the stomach lining (18) (29), decreased adherence of oral streptococci strains to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (23) and glucan-coated hydroxyapatite, and impaired biofilm formation (22) (30) indicating it may slow dental plaque development and protect against plaque-related diseases. Cranberry also regulated aggressive human periodontitis fibroblast inflammatory responses via nuclear factor-kappaB and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3) inhibition (47).
Additional studies have shown that C-PACs may play a role in enhancing host innate immunity. In a worm model, a standardized cranberry extract mediated host immune response via p38 MAPK signaling, insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling, and heat shock factor 1 (45). Antiatherogenic effects of cranberry juice occur via reductions in serum glucose and apoB, and increases in serum and apoA-1 and paraoxonase, associated with stabilizing HDL (61).
Mechanisms underlying the anticancer effects of cranberry extracts and C-PACs have also been investigated. A cranberry extract inhibited prostate cancer cell growth by decreasing cyclins, cyclin-dependant kinase expression (10) , and MMP activity (31). Dose-response inhibition of gastric cancer cells to cranberry is in part due to decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression and apoptotic induction (59). A proanthocyanidin isolate arrested ovarian cancer cell growth by inhibiting VEGF and generating ROS (15). C-PACs induced cell death in esophageal adenocarcinoma via microRNA modifications within cancer cells (60), and in human lung cancer cells, they altered gene expression, induced apoptosis, and modulated cell-cycle processes (57). In high-risk neuroblastoma cells, a purified C-PAC induced apoptosis and ROS generation, and encouraged cyclophosphamide retention with synergistic cytotoxic benefits (58).
Cranberry juice increases the risk of uric acid stone formation because of its acidifying effect and slowing of urate synthesis, thereby decreasing urinary pH (32) (33).","Vaccinium macrocarpon- Fruit | Cranberry can be consumed as juice, sauce, or dried fruit.","Mossberry | Sassamanash | Bounceberry | Agrio, Airelle à Gros Fruits, Airelle Canneberge, Airelle Européenne, Airelle Rouge, American Cranberry, Arándano, Arándano Americano, Arándano Rojo, Arándano Trepador, Atoca, Atoka, Bearberry, Canneberge, Canneberge à Feuillage Persistant, Canneberge d'Amérique, Canneberge Européenne, Cocktail au Jus de Canneberge, Cranberry Extract, Cranberry Fruit, Cranberry Fruit Juice, Cranberry Juice, Cranberry Juice Cocktail, Cranberry Juice Concentrate, Cranberry Powder, Cranberry Powdered Extract, Craneberry, Da Guo Yue Jie, Da Guo Yue Ju, Da Guo Suan Guo Man Yue Ju, European Cranberry, Extrait de Canneberge, Große Moosbeere, Gros Atoca, Grosse Moosbeere, Jus de Canneberge, Jus de Canneberge à Base de Concentré, Jus de Canneberge Frais, Kliukva, Kliukva Obyknovennaia, Kranbeere, Large Cranberry, Man Yue Ju, Man Yue Mei, Moosebeere, Mossberry, Oomi No Tsuruko Kemomo, Oxycoccus hagerupii, Oxycoccus macrocarpos, Oxycoccus microcarpus, Oxycoccus palustris, Oxycoccus quadripetalus, Petite Cannberge, Pois de Fagne, Pomme des Prés, Ronce d'Amerique, Sirop de Canneberge, Small Cranberry, Trailing Swamp Cranberry, Tsuru-Kokemomo, Vaccinium hagerupii, Vaccinium macrocarpon, Vaccinium microcarpum, Vaccinium oxycoccos, Vaccinium palustre.",Cranberry,Cranberry Protein | Cranberry Fiber | Mountain Cranberry (unspecified) | Small Cranberry,Cranberry,Cranberry

DSI002597,Cinnamon,C2740768,"Cinnamon refers to several plants that belong to the genus Cinnamomum, native to Southeast Asia. The bark, rich in essential oil, is used as a flavoring agent and as a spice. Medicinal uses include appetite stimulation, and treatment of arthritis, inflammation, and dyspepsia. In traditional Chinese medicine, cinnamon is used along with other herbs in decoctions to treat colds. In vitro studies suggest that cinnamon has antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , immunomodulatory , antimicrobial , antitumor , and antiestrogenic properties. Studies in humans have also been conducted. In clinical trials of cinnamon for type 2 diabetes, results are conflicting . Various meta-analyses and a review suggest some improvements in glycemic control with cinnamon and its extracts , but studies had high heterogeneity and larger well-designed trials are needed. Other meta-analyses suggest cinnamon supplementation may reduce blood triglycerides, total cholesterol concentrations , and C-reactive protein levels , but again well-designed studies are needed to confirm these effects. Other preliminary data suggest cinnamon extracts may decrease insulin resistance in women with polycystic ovary syndrome ; improve parameters of metabolic syndrome ; and reduce dental plaque and gingivitis . Studies involving topical use of a cinnamon ointment suggest it can relieve perineal pain and improve healing of episiotomy incisions in postpartum women . In a safety study of patients with prediabetes, a water-soluble cinnamon extract did not appear to affect electrocardiographic measures . However, certain cinnamon products are high in coumarin , which can cause hepatotoxicity and interact with other prescription drugs . | Cassia cinnamon (Cinnamomum aromaticum) is made from the dried inner bark of an evergreen tree. It's the most common type of cinnamon sold in North America. Cassia cinnamon contains chemicals that seem to improve insulin sensitivity, which might help blood sugar control in people with diabetes. It also contains cinnamaldehyde. This chemical might help fight bacteria and fungi. Cassia cinnamon is a very common spice and flavoring agent in foods. As medicine, people most commonly use cassia cinnamon for diabetes. It is also used for prediabetes, obesity, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse cassia cinnamon with other types of cinnamon, including Ceylon cinnamon, Indian cassia, Padang cassia, and Saigon cinnamon. Also don't confuse cassia cinnamon with other plants known as cassia, including cassia auriculata and cassia nomame. These are not the same. | Ceylon cinnamon (Cinnamomum verum) is a type of cinnamon that comes from the bark of an evergreen tree. Sri Lanka provides about 80% of the world's supply. The oils found in Ceylon cinnamon are thought to reduce spasms, reduce gas, and fight bacteria and fungi. Chemicals in Ceylon cinnamon might also work like insulin to lower blood sugar. But these effects are thought to be fairly weak. People use Ceylon cinnamon for diabetes, indigestion, diarrhea, obesity, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse Ceylon cinnamon with other types of cinnamon, including Cassia cinnamon, Padang cassia, Indian cassia, or Saigon cinnamon. These are not the same. | Saigon cinnamon is a type of cinnamon made from the bark of trees (Cinnamomum loureirii) that grow in Vietnam. It's used in traditional Chinese medicine. Saigon cinnamon contains chemicals that might affect blood sugar and also have anti-inflammatory effects. It also contains a chemical called coumarin which might harm the liver. People use Saigon cinnamon for diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse Saigon cinnamon with cassia cinnamon, Ceylon cinnamon, Indian cassia, or Padang cassia. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : Cassia cinnamon is commonly consumed in foods. It is likely safe when used as medicine, short-term. Doses of 1-2 grams daily have been used safely for up to 3 months. Cassia cinnamon is possibly unsafe when taken in doses larger than 6 grams daily for a long period of time. Cassia cinnamon contains a chemical called coumarin. Taking large amounts of coumarin can cause liver damage in some people, especially those who have liver disease. But for most people, it shouldn't cause serious side effects. When applied to the skin : Cassia cinnamon is possibly safe when used short-term. It might cause skin irritation and allergic skin reactions. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Cassia cinnamon is commonly consumed in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if cassia cinnamon is safe to use in larger amounts while pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts. Children : Cassia cinnamon is possibly safe when taken by mouth appropriately. One gram of cassia cinnamon daily has been used safely in teens for up to 3 months. Liver disease : Cassia cinnamon contains a chemical that might harm the liver. If you have liver disease, do not take cassia cinnamon in amounts larger than those normally found in food. Perioperative : Cassia cinnamon might lower blood sugar and might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop taking cassia cinnamon as a medicine at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery. | When taken by mouth : Ceylon cinnamon is commonly consumed in foods. It is possibly safe when used as a medicine. It has been safely used in doses of 0.5-3 grams daily for up to 6 months. There isn't enough reliable information to know if Ceylon cinnamon is safe when taken in larger amounts or when used long-term.

Cinnamon also inhibits hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity (24) and reduces blood lipid levels in animals and humans (10). In another study, methylhydroxychalcone polymer isolated from cinnamon was shown to mimic insulin by activating the insulin receptors (23).
Cinnamon extract binds to estrogen-receptor beta and has a direct stimulatory effect on bone formation (25). The n-hexane extract of cinnamon has antiestrogenic activity (26).

Preclinical studies suggest that myrrh has anti-inflammatory, cytotoxic , anti-trichomoniasis , and antipyretic effects . Other experiments suggest some constituents of myrrh may inhibit certain cancers , but human data are lacking. A small study suggests effectiveness of myrrh against trichomoniasis vaginalis in affected women . Other preliminary data on different herbal preparations containing myrrh suggest potential benefit as maintenance therapy in patients with ulcerative colitis and in women with type 2 diabetes , but additional studies are needed. | Myrrh is a yellow, fragrant, sap-like resin that comes out of cuts in the bark of certain Commiphora trees, including the Commiphora myrrham tree. Myrrh contains chemicals that might reduce pain and kill bacteria. It's used worldwide but is especially popular in China and Egypt. People use myrrh for back pain, diarrhea, parasite infections, wound healing, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using myrrh for COVID-19. Don't confuse myrrh with guggul. These are related but not the same.",When taken by mouth : Myrrh is commonly consumed in foods as a flavoring agent. Myrrh is possibly safe when used as medicine in doses of 400 mg three times daily for up to 12 months. It's usually well-tolerated. But taking large doses of myrrh is possibly unsafe. Doses greater than 2-4 grams can cause kidney problems and heart rate changes. When applied to the skin : Myrrh is possibly safe for most people. It's been used safely in a diluted bath for up to 7 days. It might cause a skin rash in some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Myrrh is likely unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. Myrrh can stimulate the uterus and might cause a miscarriage. There isn't enough reliable information to know if myrrh is safe to use on the skin when pregnant. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if myrrh is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Surgery : Myrrh might affect blood sugar levels. This might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop using myrrh at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.,"In animal studies, an aqueous suspension of C. molmol protected against gastric mucosal damage from NSAIDs and ethanol (7). C. molmol may have free radical-scavenging, thyroid-stimulating, and prostaglandin-inducing properties. These effects are caused by increased mucus production, and nucleic acid and non-protein sulfhydryl concentrations. Aqueous extracts of myrrh may induce hepatic microsomal enzymes, causing a more rapid metabolism of warfarin (10).
C. molmol inhibits the growth of Ehrlich carcinoma cells in mice (4). The cytotoxic activities appear to be as effective as cyclophosphamide in solid tumor-bearing mice. In one study, Na, K and Ca levels in cancer cells were reduced by treatment with C. molmol, leading to inhibition of cellular proliferation and tumor growth (3). Another in vitro study found that myrrh gum had tumoricidal effects against a malignant murine neuroblastoma cell line (5). The antiproliferative activity of sesquiterpenoids ST1 and ST2 from myrrh in human prostate cancer cells may occur through androgen receptor signaling inhibition (12).","Gum-resin from Commiphora molmol, Commiphora abyssinica, and other Commiphora species.","Mo Yao | Abyssinica | Heerabol | Abyssinian Myrrh, African Myrrh, Amyris kataf, Arabian Myrrh, Bal, Balsamodendron Myrrha, Balsamodendrum habessinicum, Balsamodendrum myrrha, Bdellium, Bol, Bola, Commiphora, Commiphora abyssinica, Commiphora erythraea, Commiphora habessinica, Commiphora kataf, Commiphora madagascariensis, Commiphora molmol, Commiphora myrrha, Common Myrrh, Didin, Didthin, Gomme de Myrrhe, Gum Myrrh, Heerabol, Hemprichia erythraea, Mirra, Mirrh, Mo Yao, Murrah, Myrrh Gum, Myrrha, Myrrhe, Myrrhe Africaine, Myrrhe Amère, Myrrhe d'Arabie, Myrrhe Bisabol, Myrrhe Douce, Myrrhe de Somalie, Myrrhe du Yémen, Opopanax, Resina Commiphorae, Somalien Myrrh, Yemen Myrrh.",Myrrha | Myrrh,Myrrh,Myrrh,Myrrh

DSI002820,SAMe,C0036002,"SAM-e is endogenously produced in the human body from adenosine triphosphate and methionine . It is involved in the formation of monoamine neurotransmitters such as serotonin and norepinephrine . Decreased SAM-e levels in cerebrospinal fluid are thought to contribute to the etiologies of depression and Alzheimer’s disease . SAM-e levels may also be decreased in chronic liver disease and AIDS-associated myelopathy . In the United States, SAM-e is marketed as a supplement to enhance mood, brain and neural function, joint mobility, and liver detoxification. It is also a prescription drug in other countries. Preclinical data suggest that SAM-e may have antidepressive , neuroprotective , anti-inflammatory , and chondroprotective effects. Other models suggest liver injury can be exacerbated by depleted SAM-e levels, and that supplementation may have hepatoprotective effects . In humans, data on whether SAM-e is an effective adjunct for major depressive disorder are mixed , and whether it is more effective than escitalopram or placebo is also unclear , although it may have greater therapeutic potential in men . Other double-blind studies have not found SAM-e, either as monotherapy or in a nutraceutical combination, helpful for major depressive disorder , and various analyses remain mixed on its potential benefit . Preliminary data suggest SAM-e may improve memory-related cognitive symptoms in depressed patients . However, studies that suggest cognitive benefits for patients with Alzheimer’s disease do not evaluate SAM-e in isolation . Although preliminary trials suggest some benefit in fibromyalgia patients , results are mixed on whether SAM-e is comparable with NSAIDs for osteoarthritis , and it did not significantly improve neurological measures in patients with AIDS-associated myelopathy . In addition, a steering committee examining whether dietary ingredients could help reduce pain determined there was insufficient evidence for SAM-e . For hot flashes, SAM-e was ineffective compared with historical placebo . Some trials suggest benefit in chronic liver disease . Addition of oral SAM-e to injected pegylated interferon alpha and oral ribavirin improved viral response in patients with chronic hepatitis C . Postoperative intravenous SAM-e therapy improved residual liver function in patients with cirrhosis . However, in patients with hepatitis C cirrhosis at elevated risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, oral SAM-e did not improve liver function or reduce injury or oxidative stress . Other preliminary data suggest it may be useful as adjunctive palliative therapy in advanced biliary tract carcinoma or protect against chemotherapy-induced liver toxicity . Additional confirmatory studies are needed to assess efficacy and safety. While generally well-tolerated, the therapeutic value of SAM-e in chronic liver disease is limited or yet to be determined. Because it is poorly absorbed, enteric-coated tablets are preferred. Outside the United States, parenteral formulations are used to treat fibromyalgia , osteoarthritis, and tendonitis as well as depression. However, patients with bipolar disorder or taking serotonergic medications including antidepressants should discuss any use of this supplement with their treating physician, as cases of mania and serotonin syndrome have been reported. | SAMe is a molecule that is made naturally in the body from homocysteine and folate. It can also be made in a lab and taken in supplements. SAMe is involved in the formation, activation, and breakdown of other chemicals in the body, including hormones, proteins, and certain drugs. The body uses it to make certain chemicals that play a role in pain, depression, liver disease, and other conditions. People most commonly take SAMe for depression and osteoarthritis. It is also used for anxiety, liver disease, fibromyalgia, schizophrenia, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. SAMe has been available as a dietary supplement in the US since 1999, but it has been used as a prescription drug in Italy, Spain, and Germany for many decades.","When taken by mouth : SAMe is likely safe. Side effects might include gas, diarrhea, constipation, dry mouth, headache, and nervousness, especially at higher doses. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if SAMe is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Bipolar disorder : SAMe can cause people with bipolar disorder to enter a manic state. If you have bipolar disorder, don't use SAMe. Inherited disorder called Lesch-Nyhan syndrome : SAMe might make symptoms of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome worse. Parkinson disease : There is some concern that SAMe might make symptoms of Parkinson disease worse. Surgery : SAMe might affect the central nervous system. This could interfere with surgery. Stop taking SAMe at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","SAM-e is endogenously produced from adenosine triphosphate and the amino acid methionine. It is a major, ubiquitous methyl donor to a wide variety of molecules (26), including catecholamines and other biogenic amines, fatty acids, neurotransmitters, nucleic acids, polysaccharides, porphyrins, proteins and membrane phospholipids. Homocysteine is formed through the transsulfuration pathway and is catabolized to cysteine and indirectly to glutathione.
In preclinical models, SAM-e protected against amyloid-beta-induced cellular injury by inhibiting oxidative stress and neuroinflammation (34). It also increased the endogenous antioxidant glutathione and potentiated antioxidant enzyme activity. Supplementation with SAM-e restores hepatic glutathione deposits and attenuates liver injury (26). The mechanism by which SAM-e might treat depression is unknown, but increased synthesis of neurotransmitters such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, may increase responsiveness of neurotransmitter receptors and fluidity of cell membranes in the production of phospholipids (2) (3) (4).",Disulfate Monotosylate,"SAM-e | SAMe | SAM | Adomet | Ademetionine, Adenosylmethionine, Adénosylméthionine, AdoMet, S-Adenosyl Methionine, S-Adénosyl Méthionine, S-Adenosyl-L-Methionine, S-Adénosyl-L-Méthionine, S-Adenosylmethionine, S-Adénosylméthionine, S-Adenosylmethionine Butanedisulfonate, S-Adenosylmethionine Tosylate, S-Adenosylmethionine Tosylate Disulfate, SAM, SAM-e, Sammy, Samyr.",SAMe | S-adenosylmethionine | S-Adenosylmethionine,SAMe | SAM-e,SAM-e,SAMe

DSI002854,Pomegranate,C4759843,"Pomegranate is a small fruit-bearing tree native to Asia, but it is also cultivated in many parts of the world including the United States. The fruit juice extracted from the arils of the seeds is used in drinks and as a dietary supplement. Several studies suggest antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic properties, which are attributed to the presence of multiple polyphenols such as tannins, flavonols, anthocyanins, and ellagic acid . Preclinical studies also suggest pomegranate juice may suppress inflammatory cell signaling and prostate tumor growth, and lower serum PSA levels . In other experiments, it inhibited aromatase activity, endogenous estrogen biosynthesis, and breast cancer cell proliferation , and a pomegranate seed extract alleviated ciplatin-induced hepatotoxicity in animal studies . Preliminary studies in humans suggest pomegranate may have some benefit on cognition , cardiovascular disease , hyperlipidemia , or erectile dysfunction , but not COPD . Data for its use in hypertension is limited , and meta-analyses did not find pomegranate helpful to improve oxidative stress , although it may help improve some biomarkers of inflammation and vascular dysfunction . A few studies have been conducted in cancer patients. In men with favorable-risk prostate cancer on active surveillance, preliminary data suggest pomegranate fruit extract may alter biomarkers related to androgen signaling and oxidative stress . Pomegranate extract before surgery resulted in pomegranate metabolite accumulation in prostate tissue, but did not significantly lower 8-OHdG levels, a measure of oxidative damage . Data are conflicting on whether pomegranate juice can slow the rate of prostate-specific antigen increase in men with high PSA levels . A planned subset analysis suggests that those with the manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) AA genotype might benefit . Supplementation with a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli, and curcumin resulted in lower rates of PSA increase following PSA relapse post-radical treatment . However, an adjunctive intervention with pomegranate juice in men with advanced prostate cancer did not produce significant PSA reductions versus placebo . Other investigations suggest pomegranate in combination with other plant extracts may modulate gene expression for osteoclastic and osteogenic processes , but intake of pomegranate seed oil did not reduce hot flashes , and there was no overall association between pomegranate juice intake and hormonal biomarkers for breast cancer risk . Pomegranate extract influenced changes in gene expression in colon tissues from colorectal patients . In newly-diagnosed CRC patients, pomegranate consumption may lower plasma LPS-binding protein levels, a marker for endotoxemia . More studies are needed to determine the implications of such changes. Although animal studies suggested pomegranate may inhibit CYP3A and 2C9 , humans studies have not shown clinically relevant interactions . | Pomegranate (Punica granatum) is a small fruit-bearing tree. The fruit is commonly eaten as a food and has also been used medicinally in various cultures. Pomegranate contains chemicals that might have antioxidant effects. One pomegranate delivers almost 30 mg of vitamin C. Other chemicals in pomegranate juice might slow hardening of the arteries and possibly fight cancer cells. People use pomegranate for high blood pressure, athletic performance, heart disease, diabetes, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using pomegranate for COVID-19.","When taken by mouth : Pomegranate fruit and fruit juice are likely safe for most people. Most people don't experience side effects and it's been used safely for up to 3 years. Pomegranate fruit and seed extract are possibly safe. Some people have experienced allergic reactions, including itching, swelling, runny nose, and difficulty breathing. The root, stem, and peel of pomegranate are possibly unsafe when used in large amounts. They contain poisonous chemicals. When applied to the skin : Pomegranate extract is possibly safe. Some people might have allergic reactions. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Pomegranate fruit and fruit juice are possibly safe when used during pregnancy or when breast-feeding. But there isn't enough reliable information to know if other forms of pomegranate, such as pomegranate extract, are safe to use. Stay on the safe side and stick with pomegranate fruit or juice. Allergies to plants : People with plant allergies seem to be more likely to have an allergic reaction to pomegranate. Surgery : Pomegranate might affect blood pressure. This might interfere with blood pressure control during and after surgery. Stop taking pomegranate at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Pomegranate juice has antioxidant and antiatherosclerotic properties due to the presence of polyphenols such as tannins, flavonols, anthocyanins, and ellagic acid. Punicalagin, an ellagitannin, is the most abundant polyphenol that accounts for >50% of antioxidant activity (1) (2).
In animal models, constituents such as ellagic acid and luteolin inhibit ovarian cancer metastasis by downregulating MMP2 and MMP9 (28). In prostate cancer cells, a pomegranate extract induced apoptosis and impaired metastasis also by downregulating MMP2/9 along with TIMP2 upregulation (29). Prevention of chemically-induced mammary carcinogenesis by another extract likely involved anti-inflammatory mechanisms such as differential regulation of NF-κB and NF-erythroid 2p45 (NF-E2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling (30). Pomegranate extract suppressed breast cancer stem cell characteristics by inhibiting the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (31). It can also inhibit aromatase activity and decrease endogenous estrogen synthesis (5).
Some commercial pomegranate juices are marketed with claims of higher antioxidant activity than green tea and red wine (13). However such effects could be due to colonic microflora metabolites and not the polyphenols present in the juice (14). Recent interest in the link between gut microbiota and cancer explores possible mechanisms. In one RCT, consumption of pomegranate decreased plasma lipopolysaccharide binding protein levels, a known marker associated with onset and development of colorectal cancer (33).","Punica granatum, Fruit | Whole fruit, juice","Chinese apple | Anardana, Dadim, Dadima, Delima, Extrait de Feuille de Grenade, Extrait de Grenade, Extrait de Polyphénol de Grenade, Feuille de Grenade, Fleur de Grenade, Fruit du Grenadier, Fruit of the Dead, Gangsalan, Granaatappel, Granad, Granada, Granado, Granatapfel, Grenade, Grenadier, Limoni, Melogranato, Melograno Granato, PE, PLE, Pomegranate Extract, Pomegranate Flower, Pomegranate Fruit, Pomegranate Leaf, Pomegranate Leaf Extract, Pomegranate Polyphenol Extract, Pomme Grenade, Pomo Granato, Pomo Punico, PPE, Punica granatum, Roma, Romazeira, Romeira, Shi Liu Gen Pi, Shi Liu Pi, Tab Tim.",Pomegranate,Pomegranate | Pomegranate Oil | Pomegranate protein,Pomegranate,Pomegranate

DSI002944,Chaste tree,C0771966,"The fruit of chasteberry is widely used to relieve premenstrual symptoms and to treat infertility. It is said to have a normalizing action on the menstrual cycle and contain nonsteroidal progestins that can interact with and activate hormone receptors in the body . Chasteberry has opioidergic , dopaminergic , hepatoprotective , and antiproliferative properties in vitro. Clinical studies suggest it can reduce PMS symptoms , but a systematic review highlighted the need for well-designed studies for definitive conclusions . Preliminary data also suggest chasteberry may help reduce mastalgia , but in combination with St. John’s wort, it was ineffective for treating menopausal symptoms . Because chasteberry has phytoestrogenic properties , patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should consult their physicians before using it.",,"In vitro studies have identified several flavonoids in chasteberry, especially casticin, which exerts opioidergic effects through activation of mu- and delta-opioid receptor subtypes (2). Casticin reduced lung inflammation in a murine model by inhibiting numbers of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes, and by reducing levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (25).
Dopaminergic compounds, particularly clerodadienols, dose-dependently inhibited pituitary prolactin release, which could explain its effect during the premenstrual cycle when serum prolactin levels can be chronically elevated (3). Other diterpenes including rotundifuran also modulate dopamine receptors (14). Linoleic acid from chasteberry binds to estrogen receptors (ER) and can induce certain estrogen genes (12). The flavonoid apigenin was identified as the most active ER isoform-selective phytoestrogen (11), and can also induce progestogenic activity (13).
In human studies, chasteberry restores progesterone concentrations, prolongs the hyperthermic phase in the basal temperature curve, and restores the luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone test to normal. It is thought to act on the pituitary-hypothalamic axis rather than directly on ovaries (11).",,Chasteberry | Vitex | Chaste tree fruit | Monk’s pepper,Chaste tree,,Chasteberry,
DSI002945,Chrysanthemum,C0008720,"Chrysanthemum is a perennial flowering plant from the Asteraceae family that is native to Asia and northeastern Europe. The flower and aerial parts of many species are used in traditional medicine to treat hypertension, angina, fever, and various inflammatory diseases. Preclinical studies have shown cytotoxic , antioxidant , antibacterial , anti-inflammatory , immunomodulatory , antiosteoporotic , and neuroprotective properties. Various species also have antidiabetic , antihyperlipidemic , and anti-atherosclerotic effects. Small studies using chrysanthemum extracts found neuroprotective effects in ischemic stroke patients , reductions in serum uric acid in patients with hyperuricemia , and improvement in knee function in those with osteoarthritis . Chrysanthemum was also found to reverse multidrug resistance in human breast cancer cells , showed anti-angiogenic and antiproliferative effects , and reduced cachexia in a murine model . | Chrysanthemum is a flowering plant that blooms in the fall. It's commonly called a mum. Its flowers are used in tea and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Chrysanthemum contains chemicals called flavonoids, which have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. It also contains chemicals that may increase blood flow to the heart. People use chrysanthemum for chest pain (angina), high blood pressure, common cold, diabetes, stroke, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Chrysanthemum extract is possibly safe when used for up to 12 weeks. But there isn't enough reliable information to know what the potential side effects might be. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if chrysanthemum is safe. Chrysanthemum can cause allergic reactions in some people. It can also cause the skin to become extra sensitive to the sun. Wear sunblock outside, especially if you are light-skinned. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if chrysanthemum is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Plant allergies : Chrysanthemum is a member of the Asteraceae/Compositae family. It may cause an allergic reaction in people sensitive to other plants from this family. Other members of this family include ragweed, marigolds, daisies, and many others.","Antioxidant effects have been attributed to various constituents, including phenolic compounds and chlorogenic acids (18) (38) (39). Anti-inflammatory mechanisms include inhibition of nitric oxide production and tumor necrosis factor-alpha secretion (40). In vitro, anti-osteoporotic activity of phenolic and flavonoid compounds from C. indicum flowers was linked to tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity (26). Another C. indicum extract inhibited formation of TRAP-positive mature osteoclasts, disrupted bone resorption, and enhanced primary osteoblast differentiation via upregulation of alkaline phosphatase expression and extracellular calcium concentrations (25). A C. zawadskii ethanol extract inhbited osteoclastogenesis through suppression of ERK activation and other mechanisms to negatively regulate osteoclast differentiation. In diabetes-associated bone disease, C. zawadskii attenuation of dRib-induced cell damage in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells was attributed to antioxidant activity and effects on differentiation related to bone recovery (30).
In animal models, handelin from C. boreale produced anti-inflammatory effects that were linked to downregulation of NF-kappaB signaling and pro-inflammatory cytokine production (23). A polyphenol-rich C. morifolium extract inhibited hyperlipidemic fatty liver in mice through the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha-mediated pathway (33). Chrysanthemum significantly decreased serum IgE, IgG1, IL-4, and IFN-γ levels and reduced mRNA levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-13 in dorsal skin lesions (16) .
Chrysanthemum reversed multidrug resistance in human breast cancer cells via inhibition of P-glycoprotein activity (15) . It induced apoptosis in various tumor cells via inhibition of JAK1/2 and STAT3 signaling pathways (12) . Antiproliferative effects in lung cancer cells were attributed to suppression of the Akt-dependent signaling pathway by the constituent linarin (37).

DSI003014,Chitosan,C0162969,"Chitosan (KY-to-san) is a derivative of chitin, extracted from the exoskeleton of crustaceans, including shrimp, lobster, and clams, and from the cell wall of reishi mushrooms . Chitosan is used as an excipient in pharmaceutical formulations and in biomedical applications including wound dressings. It is also made into an edible film to protect food from spoilage . Chitosan is marketed as an all-natural marine fiber to help manage weight and cholesterol. Animal models suggest antiobesity properties with chitosan and derivative products . In one animal study, a combination of capsaicin and chitosan increased this activity . Findings from human studies are conflicting. Although marketers of weight loss supplements claim chitosan can bind with fat in the intestine, some clinical trials did not find any increase in fecal excretion of fat or weight loss compared with placebo . Other studies have had more positive results in combination with additional products or interventions . Various studies and meta-analyses suggest chitosan may decrease diastolic blood pressure at higher dosages , improve serum lipid profiles , and have some benefit on glycemic regulation . Benefit on weight management are mixed . More trials are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn. Chitosan may increase total plasma antioxidant activity and lower oxidative stress . Limited clinical data are available regarding efficacy for anemia or chronic renal failure . Reported adverse events include constipation and gastrointestinal distress . Patients allergic to shellfish or mushrooms should use related supplements with caution. | Chitosan is a sugar that comes from the outer skeleton of shellfish, including crab, lobster, and shrimp. It's used as medicine and in drug manufacturing. Chitosan is a fibrous substance that might reduce how much fat and cholesterol the body absorbs from foods. It also helps blood clot when applied to wounds. People use chitosan for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, wound healing, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Chitosan is possibly safe when used for up to 3 months. It might cause stomach upset, constipation, or gas. When applied to the skin : Chitosan is possibly safe when used short-term. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if chitosan is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Shellfish allergy : Chitosan is taken from the outer skeleton of shellfish. People with allergies to shellfish might also be allergic to chitosan.","Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide that consists of glucosamine and N-acetylglucosamine copolymers (14). It has been described as biodegradable, nontoxic, non-immunogenic, and biocompatible (25), with properties similar to cellulose (2).
In an in vitro study, chitosan demonstrated antioxidant effects by reducing albumin carobonyls and hydroperoxides in a time-dependent manner (9).
In animal models, antiobesity effects may occur through serum leptin and C-reactive protein modulation (14) or AMPK activation and lipogenesis-associated gene inhibition (15). In porcine models, chitosan altered genes influencing appetite and feeding behavior in the small intestine (NPY), adipose tissue (Leptin), and the brain (HCRT, INSR, NMB, GHR, PPARG, NPY5R) (17). It also downregulated FABP2 gene expression, increased serum leptin, and significantly altered gut microbial populations (16). In high-fat diet-induced obese rodents, chitosan oligosaccharides improved dyslipidemia and prevented body weight gain by inhibiting adipocyte differentiation (19). As an insoluble fiber, low molecular weight chitosan polyglucosamines can bind to fat in the intestinal lumen, forming a complex that is partially utilized by colon bacteria and partially eliminated (22) (26) (27), but appropriate concentrations are needed. In one of these animal studies, it was suggested that the more likely mechanisms for weight loss could include bacterial energy wasting, as increased acetate and glucose excretion were also present, suggesting that larger amounts of lipids and glucose were available as fuel for bacteria in the colon (26).
Hypocholesterolemic effects from chitosan in murine models were not due to reduced cholesterol absorption efficiency or increases in fecal sterol output, so that a major bile acid-binding capacity was ruled out (28). The more likely scenario is that the fiber’s influence on satiation and satiety reduces food intake suppression and therefore cholesterol (29).
Human studies suggest that it is unlikely that chitosan binds fat in intestines, and could therefore not support this purported mechanism of action (21) (30).
Topical application enhances wound healing by stimulation of granulation tissue.

DSI003063,Psyllium,C0033979,"Black psyllium comes from the seed husks of the Plantago arenaria plant. It contains high amounts of soluble dietary fiber. Black psyllium adds bulk to the stool which might help with constipation, diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It also controls how quickly sugars are absorbed from the gut, which might help control blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. People commonly use black psyllium for treating and preventing constipation. It is also used for diarrhea, obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. Don't confuse black psyllium with blond psyllium. These are not the same. | Blond psyllium (Plantago ovata) is an herb. Its seed husk is used as a laxative and stool softener and to help reduce cholesterol. Psyllium seed husks absorb water in the stomach and form a large mass. This mass stimulates the bowel in people with constipation. In people with diarrhea, it can slow down the bowel and reduce bowel movements. This mass can also reduce the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the body. Blond psyllium is commonly used as a stool softener in people with constipation and hemorrhoids. It is also used for diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), high cholesterol, heart disease, and diabetes. It's used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these other uses.","When taken by mouth : Black psyllium is likely safe when consumed with plenty of water. Drink at least 8 ounces of fluids for every 3-5 grams of husk or 7 grams of seed. Mild side effects include bloating and gas. In some people, black psyllium can cause allergic reactions. Black psyllium is likely unsafe when consumed without enough water. It might cause choking or block the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Taking black psyllium during pregnancy or breast-feeding seems to be safe, as long as enough fluids are taken with each dose. Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders : Don't use black psyllium if you tend to develop hard stools in the rectum due to GI tract narrowing, or have a condition that can lead to obstruction, such as spastic bowel. Phenylketonuria : Some black psyllium products might be sweetened with aspartame (NutraSweet). If you have phenylketonuria, avoid these products. Swallowing disorders : Do not use black psyllium if you have problems swallowing.

DSI003084,Andrographolide,C0051821,"Andrographis paniculata is a bitter tasting annual plant prevalent in much of Asia. It is often used in combination with other herbs in traditional medicine to treat infectious diseases and associated fevers. It is also used in folk medicine to treat snakebites. Andrographis is promoted in supplemental form for cancer prevention or treatment, and to counter chemotherapy toxicity in humans. Formulations containing standardized extracts of andrographis are also marketed for colds and flu. Preclinical studies suggest antimicrobial , anti-inflammatory , antioxidant , anticancer properties. Kan Jang, a standardized extract of A. paniculata and Eleutherococcus senticosus, has been studied in manufacturer-sponsored clinical trials for relief of respiratory symptoms from cold and flu , and may help reduce severity and recovery time . An andrographis extract also appeared helpful for upper respiratory infections and meta-analyses suggest possible benefit to reduce cough frequency and severity . Andrographis has also been evaluated for ulcerative colitis. In one trial, those receiving A. paniculata extract at higher doses were more likely to achieve a clinical response compared with placebo , and another study found it as effective as mesalamine . Other preliminary data suggest andrographis extracts can reduce rheumatoid factors and arthritis symptoms . In patients with modest hypertriglyceridemia, reduced triglyceride levels with a high-dose andrographis extract were comparable to reductions with gemfibrozil . In a pilot study of patients with not-active progressive multiple sclerosis, andrographolide appeared safe and showed trends in reducing brain atrophy rates and disability progression . | Andrographis (Andrographis paniculate) is a plant native to South Asian countries. It is commonly used in the traditional Indian medicine system, Ayurveda. Andrographis leaf and stem might work by stimulating the immune system. It might also prevent flu viruses from binding to cells in the body. People commonly use andrographis for the common cold, osteoarthritis, infection of the throat and tonsils, and a type of bowel disease called ulcerative colitis. It is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support its other uses.","When taken by mouth : Andrographis is likely safe when used in doses up to 340 mg daily for up to 12 months. It also appears to be safe when taken as a specific combination product containing andrographis extract and eleuthero (Kan Jang, Swedish Herbal Institute) for 4-7 days. Andrographis can cause side effects such diarrhea, vomiting, rash, headache, runny nose, and fatigue. Side effects are more likely with higher doses. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Andrographis is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. There is a concern that it might cause miscarriage. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if andrographis is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Andrographis is possibly safe in children when taken by mouth, short-term. Andrographis has been used in combination with other herbs for up to one month in children 3-15 years of age. ""Auto-immune diseases"" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions : Andrographis might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using andrographis. Bleeding conditions : Andrographis might slow blood clotting. This might increase the risk of bleeding or bruising in people with bleeding disorders. Surgery : Andrographis might slow blood clotting and reduce blood pressure. It might cause extra bleeding or low blood pressure during and after surgery. Stop using andrographis at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","The active constituents of andrographis are diterpenoid lactones known as andrographolides (10) (11). They exhibit anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting NO production and COX-2 expression (26). In mouse hepatocytes, andrographis induced mRNA expression of CYP1A1 and 1A2 in a concentration-dependent manner (31). In other studies, andrographis extract demonstrated a calcium channel inhibition effect that could cause smooth muscle relaxation, decreased blood pressure and heart rate (32), and relaxation of the uterus (33). It also showed antiplatelet effects by inhibiting thrombin (34) and platelet activating factor (35). When given orally to mice, andrographis extract neutralized snake venom (9).
In other preclinical studies, activity against multiple myeloma cells may occur via TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway inhibition (52). In human colorectal cancer cells, reversal of 5-FU resistance was attributed to elevated BAX expression (50). Migration and invasion was inhibited through suppression of mRNA and MMP-7 protein levels (13), while MMP-2 activity was also identified (14). Inhibition of IL-6 expression and IL-6-mediated signals occurred in human prostate cancer cells (12). In non-small cell lung cancer cells andrographolides reduced invasiveness by suppressing the PI3K/Akt/AP-1 signaling pathway and inhibiting MMP-7 expression (15). Apoptosis in human hepatoma cells occurred via c-Jun N-terminal kinase induction (16) and caspase activation (17). Decreased adhesion of gastric cancer cells to endothelial tissue was attributed to inhibition of E-selection expression (18). Inhibition of tumor cell growth may also occur by stimulating cytotoxic T-lymphocyte production via IL-2 and IFN-gamma secretion (19). Andrographolides also enhanced doxorubicin-induced cell death in several human cancer cell lines, mainly through JAK-STAT suppression (20).
In HIV patients, andrographolides inhibited HIV-induced cell-cycle dysregulation and increased CD4+ lymphocyte levels (10).",Aerial parts | Aerial parts,"Indian Echinacea | Chuan Xin Lian | Chiretta | Kalmegh | Andrographis paniculata, Andrographolide, Bhunimba, Bidara, Carmantina, Carmantine, Chiretta, Chirette Verte, Chirreta, Chuan Xin Lian, Chuanxinlian, Chuan Xin Lin, Creat, Échinacée d'Inde, Fa-Tha-Lai-Jone, Fa-Tha-Lai-Jone, Gubak, Herba Andrographitis, Indian Echinacea, Justicia paniculata, Justicie, Kalamegha, Kalmegh, Kalmegha, Kariyat, King of Bitters, Kirta, Mahalita, Nabin Chanvandi, Nemone Chinensi, Poogiphalam, Roi des Amers, Sadilata, Sambilata, Shivaphala, Supari, Takila, Vizra Ufar, Yavatikta.",Andrographolide | Andrographis Paniculata Extract,Andrographolide | Andrographis,Andrographis,Andrographis

DSI003104,Ginger,C2740621,"Derived from the rhizome of the plant, ginger is native to Asia and used as food and medicine. In traditional Chinese medicine, ginger is used to expel “cold”, “wind” and “dampness”, and is believed to stop the reverse flow of Qi (energy) . Western use has been primarily for gastrointestinal symptoms and respiratory ailments. Preclinical studies indicate that ginger has antiemetic , anticancer , anti-inflammatory , anti-drug-dependence , and hypoglycemic effects . It may also protect against Alzheimer’s disease . Ginger influences gastric emptying in healthy individuals and may promote feelings of satiety . Data suggest its effectiveness for treating dysmenorrhea , as well as moderate efficacy against osteoarthritic and chronic low back pain . As an adjunct to standard care, ginger may also be beneficial for treating migraine . Although clinical trials indicate that ginger can reduce nausea and vomiting, it should be avoided perioperatively due to anticoagulant/antiplatelet effects , and during pregnancy since animal studies highlight concerns regarding embryo development . Dietary ginger seems to be without these effects , although some studies suggest that high concentrations of fresh ginger have antiplatelet effects . In oncology settings, ginger may prevent chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) , but a systemic review cited the need for further research . Another study suggested that adjuvant ginger supplementation may improve CIN-related quality of life and cancer-related fatigue . The bioactive compound 6-gingerol may also improve overall CINV, appetite, and quality of life . However other studies did not show benefit with ginger as an adjunct to CINV prophylaxis , or in patients receiving high-dose cisplatin except in female and head and neck cancer subgroups . Supplementation may have chemopreventive effects for those at increased risk for colon cancer with normal-appearing colonic mucosa . Larger studies are needed to confirm potential benefits of ginger supplementation for symptom control or for chemoprevention. Other studies report ginger aromatherapy to be useful in reducing nausea and vomiting in postoperative patients , but data on CINV are mixed . | Ginger (Zingiber officinale) is a plant native to Asia. The ginger spice comes from the roots of the plant. It's used as a food flavoring and medicine. Ginger contains chemicals that might reduce nausea and swelling. These chemicals seem to work in the stomach and intestines, but they might also help the brain and nervous system to control nausea. People commonly use ginger for many types of nausea and vomiting. It's also used for menstrual cramps, osteoarthritis, diabetes, migraine headaches, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using ginger for COVID-19.","When taken by mouth : Ginger is likely safe. It can cause mild side effects including heartburn, diarrhea, burping, and general stomach discomfort. Taking higher doses of 5 grams daily increases the risk for side effects. When applied to the skin : Ginger is possibly safe when used short-term. It might cause skin irritation for some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Ginger is likely safe when eaten in foods. It is possibly safe when taken by mouth as medicine during pregnancy. It might increase the risk of bleeding, so some experts advise against using it close to the delivery date. But it appears to be safe to use for morning sickness without harm to the baby. Talk to your healthcare provider before using ginger during pregnancy. Breast-feeding : Ginger is likely safe when eaten in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if taking larger amounts of ginger is safe when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Ginger is possibly safe when taken by mouth for up to 4 days by teenagers around the start of their period. Bleeding disorders : Taking ginger might increase your risk of bleeding. Heart conditions : High doses of ginger might worsen some heart conditions. Surgery : Ginger might slow blood clotting. It might cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using ginger at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Antiemetic actions are attributed to shogaol and gingerol compounds present in the rhizome, which stimulate flow of saliva, bile, and gastric secretions, and galanolactone, which can act as a competitive antagonist at serotonin 5-HT3 receptors (2) (22). Additional activities include stimulation of antral contractions, reduction of postprandial antral area, and acceleration of gastric emptying (13). Ginger inhibits thromboxane formation and platelet aggregation (43). However, these effects appear to be dose- and formulation-dependent (eg, dried, fresh, or extract) (31).
In vitro studies suggest that fresh ginger stimulates mucosal cells to secrete IFN-β to combat viral infection (32), while certain ginger preparations reduced lipopolysaccharide-induced secretion of IL-8 in human bronchial epithelial cells (8), and inhibited human telomerase reverse transcriptase and c-Myc expression in human lung cancer cells (44).
In other studies, gingerol induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells through TRAIL-dependent caspase 3/7 activation (3) and inhibited cell-cycle progression by reducing cyclin D1 expression (4). It also inhibited secretion of angiogenic cytokines such as VEGF and IL-8 in ovarian cancer cells (5). In animal models, shogaol reduced tumor growth by damaging microtubules and by inducing mitotic arrest (3). Increased levels of circulating antioxidant and phase II enzymes and reduced lipid peroxidation levels are mechanisms by which ginger might protect against DMH-induced colon cancers (45).",Zingiber officinale - Rhizome,"Ginger root | Shen jiang | African Ginger, Amomum Zingiber, Ardraka, Black Ginger, Cochin Ginger, Gan Jiang, Gingembre, Gingembre Africain, Gingembre Cochin, Gingembre Indien, Gingembre Jamaïquain, Gingembre Noir, Ginger Essential Oil, Ginger Root, Huile Essentielle de Gingembre, Imber, Indian Ginger, Jamaica Ginger, Jengibre, Jiang, Kankyo, Kanshokyo, Nagara, Race Ginger, Racine de Gingembre, Rhizoma Zingiberi, Rhizoma Zingiberis, Rhizoma Zingiberis Recens, Shen Jiang, Sheng Jiang, Shoga, Shokyo, Shunthi, Srungavera, Sunth, Sunthi, Vishvabheshaja, Zingiber Officinale, Zingiberis Rhizoma, Zingiberis Siccatum Rhizoma, Zinzeberis, Zinziber Officinale, Zinziber Officinalis.",Ginger,African Ginger | Ginger | Spiked Ginger Lily,Ginger,Ginger

It has been historically used to relieve constipation, stomach aches, colds, fever, as an eye lotion, and to induce labor. Currently it is used as a laxative and as an emollient in cosmetics and personal care products, drug delivery systems and wound dressings . Castor oil is approved by the FDA for safe and effective use as a stimulant laxative.In preclinical studies castor oil demonstrated antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, wound-healing, antinociceptive and cytotoxic effects . Limited clinical data suggest benefits for eye diseases , knee osteoarthritis and a meta-analysis determined it can potentially improve the completion rate (CR) and polyp detection rate in colon capsule endoscopy (CCE). The authors suggest it should be actively considered as a viable component for bowel preparation alongside other emerging laxative regimens . Studies also support use of castor oil for inducing labor .Castor oil and CancerCenturies ago, castor oil was among the treatment options for breast cancer that was attributed to an excess of black bile by the Greek physicians Hippocrates and Galen . Castor oil packs were also popularized in the 1920s by Edgar Cayce, a self-proclaimed psychic and faith healer, to eradicate tumors near the breast surface .More recently, a castor plant fruit extract showed antiproliferative activity against breast cancer cell lines in vitro and a castor oil extract had a suppressive effect on S180 body tumors and ascites tumors in murine models . According to a case report, a formulation containing Balsam Peru, trypsin and hydrogenated castor oil accelerated wound healing in a breast cancer patient following radical mastectomy . But there are no studies in humans that show castor oil has anti-cancer effects.",,"Pharmacological studies revealed the main constituent ricinoleic acid to be responsible for the laxative effects of castor oil by influencing intestinal ion transport, water flux, and intestinal motility – through activation of EP3 and EP4 prostanoid receptors in smooth muscle cells.

DSI003184,Dandelion,C0877851,"Dandelion is related to the daisy family and commonly found worldwide. The flower, leaf and root of this plant are used in traditional medicine for their diuretic, cholagogic, antirheumatic and appetite-stimulating properties . In Chinese Medicine, the herb has been used to promote lactation. It is also used to reduce abscesses, especially in the breast and intestines . In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that dandelion has lipid-lowering , hepatoprotective , antiviral , anticoagulant , diuretic , anti-inflammatory , and antioxidant activities. A polyherbal extract containing dandelion was reported effective against acute non-bacterial tonsillitis in children . Dandelion root extract demonstrated anticancer effects against melanoma and leukemia , as well as pancreatic and colorectal cancer cell lines. It also showed estrogenic activity. Preclinical studies suggest increased proliferation of hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells as well as increased uterine weight in immature female rats . In addition, it can cause allergic reactions and may interact with some prescription drugs. There have been a few case reports of potential benefit in patients with blood cancers , but it is unclear whether this was definitively due to dandelion supplementation. Clinical trials are needed to determine the conditions under which dandelion may be safe and effective. | Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) is an herb native to Europe. The leaf, flower, and root have been used for various infections, but with little evidence. Dandelion is found throughout mild climates of the northern hemisphere. It contains chemicals that might decrease swelling, increase urine production, and prevent crystals from forming in the urine that could lead to infections in the kidneys and urinary tract. People use dandelion for conditions such as swollen tonsils, kidney infections, UTIs, and many others, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Dandelion is likely safe for most people when consumed in the amounts commonly found in food. It is possibly safe when taken in larger amounts. Dandelion might cause allergic reactions, stomach discomfort, diarrhea, or heartburn in some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if dandelion is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Eczema : People with eczema seem to have a higher chance of having an allergic reaction to dandelion. If you have eczema, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before taking dandelion. Bleeding disorders : Dandelion might slow blood clotting. In theory, taking dandelion might increase the risk for bruising and bleeding in people with bleeding disorders. Ragweed allergy : People who are allergic to ragweed and related plants (daisies, chrysanthemums, marigolds) might also be allergic to dandelion. But conflicting data exists. If you have allergies, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before taking dandelion. Surgery : Dandelion might slow blood clotting and lower blood sugar. It might cause extra bleeding and problems with low blood sugar during and after surgery. Stop using dandelion at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery. Kidney failure : Oxalate is a chemical that can build up in the kidneys. Dandelion might reduce how much oxalate is released through urine. In theory, this might increase the risk for complications in people with kidney problems.","The diuretic activity of dandelion may be a result of its high potassium content (23). In murine models of diet-induced fatty liver disease, dandelion leaf extract exihibited hepatoprotective effects with decreased serum levels of ALT, hepatic TG, and MDA, as well as TNF-alpha and IL-6 expression (14). At the post-transcriptional level, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties were exihibited via decreased activation of procaspase-3 to active caspase-3, and JNK phosphorylation (14). Linoleic acid, phytol and tetracosanol have been identified as bioactive compounds, with hypolipidemic effects occurring via AMP-activated protein kinase activation in human HepG2 cells (13).
Dandelion has been shown to decrease human hepatoma cell line viability by increasing tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1alpha production (9). Other research has shown that the presence of luteolin and luteolin 7-glucoside in dandelion flower extract exhibits cytotoxic activities against the colon adenocarcinoma cell line (Caco-2) (4). An isolated compound identical to lupeol, a lupane-type triterpene, inhibited cell growth and induced melanogenesis in a mouse melanoma cell line (3).

DSI003257,Indole-3-carbinol,C0063491,"Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C) is a phytochemical derived from the breakdown of glucosinolates found in cruciferous vegetables including Brussels sprouts, kale, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower . Epidemiologic studies suggest that a diet high in cruciferous vegetables is associated with protective effects and lower cancer risk .Preclinical studies suggest antimicrobial , anti-inflammatory , anti-estrogenic , and antiangiogenic effects. Potential activity against human breast , prostate , melanoma , endometrial , liver , and pancreatic cancer cells , as well as animal models of lung , laryngeal , and nasopharyngeal carcinoma have also been exhibited. In addition, preliminary experiments suggest I3C may enhance effects of vorinostat , bortezomib , tamoxifen , doxorubicin , vemurafenib , fludarabine , gemcitabine , or acetylsalicylic acid , and may reverse toxicities of dexamethasone or doxorubicin . However, these effects have not been confirmed in humans and some models suggest that I3C may also promote tumor growth . Additional studies are needed to determine under what conditions I3C could be a suitable chemopreventive agent in humans.Data from early phase clinical trials suggested that I3C is effective against precancerous cervical dysplasia and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia . In premenopausal women, a supplement containing I3C and 7-hydroxymatairesinol, a dietary ingredient, increased the urinary 2:16-hydroxyestrone ratio, a known biomarker for the reduction of breast cancer risk . More recently, an RCT of a diindolylmethane formulation (DIM, an active I3C metabolite) in breast cancer patients on tamoxifen suggest it encourages beneficial changes in estrogen metabolism and circulating sex hormone-binding globulin levels .I3C is generally well tolerated when taken orally, but it is unclear if I3C supplementation can benefit humans due to its mixed effects in preliminary studies and its ability to induce cytochrome P450 enzymes , which may cause interactions with several medications. In addition, a recent study to measure Brassica consumption in humans suggests that the chemopreventive effects derived from cruciferous vegetable consumption may plateau and not require eating large quantities or taking high-dose supplements . | Indole-3-carbinol comes from a substance called glucobrassicin, which is found in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cauliflower, and kale. The amount of glucobrassicin found in vegetables varies depending on the plant, soil, rainfall, amount of sunlight, and other factors. Indole-3-carbinol is formed when these vegetables are cut, chewed or cooked. It might have effects that prevent the growth of certain types of cancer cells. People use indole-3-carbinol for cancer prevention, liver disease, fibromyalgia, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse indole-3-carbinol with cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli, or with other chemicals found in these vegetables such as ascorbigen, diindolylmethane, or sulforaphane. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : Indole-3-carbinol is possibly safe  when used in doses up to 400 mg daily for 3-76 months. Side effects might include balance problems, diarrhea, nausea, rash, and tremors. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if indole-3-carbinol is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Indole-3-carbinol is possibly safe when taken by mouth appropriately. Doses of 6-17 mg/kg body weight have been safely used in children and teenagers for 12-76 months. Bleeding conditions : Indole-3-carbinol might slow blood clotting. Taking indole-3-carbinol might increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding disorders. Surgery : Indole-3-carbinol might slow blood clotting. Taking indole-3-carbinol might cause bleeding complications during surgery. Stop taking indole-3-carbinol at least 2 weeks before surgery.","I3C is derived from the breakdown of glucobrassicin produced in cruciferous vegetables (39). Some health-protective effects are attributed to epigenetic mechanisms (63). I3C counteracted HPV16 immune evasion by antagonizing E6 repression of E-cadherin (64). It decreased proinflammatory cytokine production and T-cell activation by acting as histone deacetylase class I inhibitors (31). Hepatoprotective mechanisms include immunomodulation and inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines (66), decreased miR-31 expression, and subsequent T-cell apoptosis (32).In cancer cells, I3C at higher doses induced apoptosis, while lower doses inhibited cell growth and cyclin E and CDK2 expression (27). Antiproliferative effects may occur by regulating microRNAs that regulate gene expression (65) and upregulation of apoptotic enzymes (48). Other observed activities include estrogen receptor modulation (15) (34) and reductions in MMP-2/9 and aromatase expression (16) (36) (37). In lung carcinoma cells, I3C induced G0/G1 apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (12). In gemcitabine-resistant pancreatic cancer cells, chemosensitizing occurred via downregulated microRNA-21 (43), lower LD50 of gemcitabine, and reactivation of the p16INK4a tumor suppressor gene (19). In melanoma cells, G1 apoptosis/arrest occurred via stabilization of wild-type PTEN expression (39). In prostate cancer cells, I3C inhibits Akt activation, androgen-dependent pathways, and inflammation (8) (38). In murine models, it reduced proinflammatory and procarcinogenic proteins (44).I3C coadministration with doxorubicin potentiated cytotoxic effects compared with either agent alone in pre-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells (49). Along with vorinostat, it modulated re-expression of critical receptors in certain triple negative breast cancer subtypes (69). I3C with genistein produced synergy of apoptosis and TRAIL in endometrial cancer cells (40). It reversed dexamethasone cytotoxicity via ROS inhibition and enhanced Nrf2 expression (54).Some animal studies suggest that I3C is both an inhibitor and promoter of carcinogenesis with strong induction of placental glutathione S-transferase foci in the liver (57), and modulatory activity that included apoptotic inhibition in colon tumors (55). In addition, I3C may promote endometrial adenocarcinoma through hepatic CYP1 induction and estrogen metabolism modulation (56).","Synthetic | Indole-3-carbinol | Broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, collards, kale, kohlrabi, mustard greens, rapeseed, rutabaga, turnips","I3C | Indole-3-methanol | 3-(Hydroxymethyl)indole | 3-Indolylcarbinol | Indolylmethanol | 1H-Indole-3-methanol, 1H-indol-3ylmethanol, 3-Hydroxymethyl Indole, 3 Hydroxymethyl Indole, I3C, Indole 3 Carbinol, 3-(hydroxymethyl), 3-(hydroxyméthyl), 3 (hydroxymethyl) Indole, 3-Indolylcarbinol, 3 Indolylcarbinol, 3-Indolylmethanol, 3 Indolylmethanol, Indole-3-Carbinol, Indinole, Indole, Indole 3 Carbinol, Indole-3-methanol, Indole-3-méthanol.",Indole-3-carbinol | Indole-3-Carbinol,Indole-3-Carbinol (I3C),Indole-3-Carbinol,Indole-3-Carbinol

DSI003263,Pueraria,C3540829,"Kudzu is a botanical used in traditional medicine to treat alcoholism, cardiovascular disease, menopausal symptoms, diabetes, fever, the common cold, and neck or eye pain. There are several species of kudzu and both the flowers and root extract are used for their medicinal properties. Isoflavones, the major components of kudzu, are thought to be responsible for its potential effects. In vitro, kudzu has demonstrated antiproliferative , anti-inflammatory , and neuroprotective properties. In animal studies, feeding with kudzu root suppressed alcohol intake and withdrawal symptoms . Studies of kudzu in humans are limited and have mostly focused on its effects on alcohol consumption or climacteric symptoms. In heavy drinkers, data suggest kudzu may be a useful adjunct to reduce alcohol intake . In moderate drinkers, it was shown to not disturb sleep wake/cycles, as can occur during withdrawal or with other medications that treat dependence . In another small study, a single dose of kudzu extract reduced alcohol consumption . Other preliminary studies suggest kudzu may improve symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats in perimenopausal women , and cognitive function in postmenopausal women . Although a topical P. mirifica gel improved vaginal symptoms in postmenopausal women, a conjugated estrogen cream was found to be more effective . A recent systematic review of P. mirifica regarding efficacy for menopausal symptoms is inconclusive . In addition, another systematic review determined that evidence on benefits for any condition with various species of kudzu are limited and unclear . Because human and animal studies suggest some estrogenic effects , individuals with hormone-sensitive cancers and those taking tamoxifen should avoid kudzu. | Kudzu (Pueraria montana) is a climbing vine native to Asia. It's now an invasive vine in the US. The root, flower, and leaf are used as medicine. Kudzu contains ingredients that might counteract the effects of alcohol. It might also have effects like estrogen. People use kudzu for alcohol use disorder, heart disease, diabetes, menopausal symptoms, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse kudzu with arrowroot, arum, cassava, wahoo, or zedoary. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : Kudzu is possibly safe when used for up to 4 months. It's usually well-tolerated. When applied into the vagina : Kudzu gel is possibly safe when used for up to 12 weeks. It may cause mild irritation during the first few days of use. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if kudzu is safe to use when pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Bleeding or blood clotting disorders : Kudzu might slow blood clotting. It might make bleeding and blood clotting disorders worse. Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Kudzu might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use kudzu. Liver disease : Taking kudzu might harm the liver. People with liver disease or a history of liver disease should avoid kudzu. Surgery : Kudzu might affect blood sugar levels and might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop taking kudzu at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Anti-inflammatory properties are attributed to decreased prostaglandin E2 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha release, both of which are involved in inflammatory processes (3). The isoflavone tectorigenin demonstrated antiproliferative activity via cell differentiation and reduced expression of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein (1). In animal studies, peurarin may alleviate chronic alcoholic liver injury via inhibition of endotoxin gut-leakage, activation of Kupffer cells, and expression of lipopolysaccharide receptors (22).
In humans, benefits from kudzu on hot flashes, night sweats, and cognitive function are also attributed to isoflavones (5) (6). Puerarin particularly has been credited with influencing alcohol consumption patterns, although the mechanism by which this might occur is unknown (19).",Root | Root,"Pueraria | Pueraria root | Ge Gen | Kudsu | Japanese arrowroot | Bidarikand, Bilaikanda, Daidzein, Dolichos hirsutus, Dolichos lobatus, Fen Ke, Fenge, Gange, Ge Gen, Gegen, Ghora-bel, Indian Kudzu, Isoflavone, Isoflavones, Japanese Arrowroot, Kakkon, Kudsu, Kudzu Vine, Kwaao Khruea, Mealy Kudzu, Nepalem, Neustanthus chinensis, Pachyrhizus thunbergianus, Pueraria, Pueraria candollei, Pueraria hirsuta, Pueraria lobata, Pueraria lobata var. chinensis, Pueraria mirifica, Pueraria montana var. chinense, Pueraria montana var. lobata, Pueraria montana var. thomsonii, Pueraria pseudohirsuta, Pueraria Root, Pueraria thomsonii, Pueraria thunbergiana, Pueraria tuberosa, Radix Puerariae, Red Indian Kudzu, Thai Kudzu Root Extract, Vidarikand, Vigne Kudzu, Wa Yaka, White Indian Kudzu, Yege.",Pueraria omeiensis | Pueraria Montana Var. thomsonii,Kudzu | Mealy Kudzu,Kudzu,Kudzu

DSI003313,Resveratrol,C0073096,"Resveratrol is a polyphenolic compound found in many botanical products. Red wine is a natural source of resveratrol as it is rich in grape skin and seeds. However, resveratrol is usually consumed as a dietary supplement for its purported antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. It is also marketed as an anti-aging supplement based on findings that it prolongs the life span of yeast cells . This effect has not yet been demonstrated in humans. A long-term randomized double-blind trial indicates that resveratrol and its major metabolites penetrate the blood-brain barrier to have effects on some biomarkers associated with Alzheimer’s disease , but a meta-analysis did not find any significant effect on memory or cognitive performance . Recent double-blind trials have also not found benefit with resveratrol on cognitive function in older adults . In a long-term trial in postmenopausal women, resveratrol improved chronic pain, somatic menopausal symptoms, circulatory function, and well-being . Additional data suggest potential bone-protective effects . But resveratrol was ineffective in reducing hormonal migrane burden in premenopausal women . Resveratrol has also been evaluated for cardioprotective effects. Earlier studies found it reduces low density lipoprotein oxidation, inhibits platelet aggregation, and may protect against atherogenesis . Consumption of wine or a resveratrol-rich grape supplement is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and may help promote circulatory system health . However, a meta-analysis did not find benefit with resveratrol supplementation on cardiovascular risk factors , it does not decrease risk of all-cause mortality in older adults , and higher doses may increase biomarker levels for cardiovascular disease risk . Resveratrol did not increase exercise capacity in patients with fatty acid oxidation (FAO) disorders and data on its effectiveness against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease are conflicting . But a formulation containing resveratrol may lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases in overweight and obese pediatric cases . Studies on resveratrol for diabetic patients are mixed , and a Cochrane review determined there is currently insufficient evidence for its use in diabetes . Data on whether it controls metabolic syndrome in obese subjects are also inconclusive , and resveratrol had no effect on insulin sensitivity or on hepatic or cardiovascular indices in overweight adults. Other studies suggest benefit with resveratrol in diabetic patients on bone density and levels of SIRT-1, a key protein in metabolism and inflammation . It may also help as adjunctive therapy to improve symptoms in rheumatoid and osteoarthritis . Preclinical experiments suggest that resveratrol has antiproliferative and antioxidant effects . In combination with radiation exposure, it exhibited dose-dependent radioprotective , radiomodulatory , radiosensitizing , cytotoxic , and neuroprotective effects. Other experiments suggest effects including chemotherapeutic potentiation and protection against chemo-induced cardiotoxicity . However, data on use of resveratrol in cancer patients are quite limited. In phase 1 pilots of colorectal cancer patients, one study suggests resveratrol may decrease tumor cell proliferation while another suggests utility may be limited to prevention rather than established cancers . Study of a high-dose micronized formula in multiple myeloma patients was stopped due to serious adverse events that included renal failure . In addition, resveratrol exhibits estrogen-like properties and activates transcription by both estrogen and androgen receptors that can lead to the stimulation of cancer cell proliferation . Therefore, larger well-designed trials are needed to determine the circumstances under which resveratrol might demonstrate safety and utility. Whereas resveratrol appears to be well tolerated in some studies, high doses can cause gastrointestinal side effects such as diarrhea . It also inhibits CYP450 enzymes and may increase the risk of adverse effects of certain drugs. Given its phytoestrogenic properties and potential for interactions, use of this supplement should be discussed with the treating physician. | Resveratrol is a chemical mostly found in red grapes and products made from these grapes (wine, juice). It may be helpful for hay fever and weight loss. Resveratrol might have many effects in the body, including expanding blood vessels and reducing blood clotting. It may also decrease pain and swelling, reduce levels of sugar in the blood, and help the body fight against disease. Resveratrol is most commonly used for high cholesterol, cancer, heart disease, and many other conditions. But there is no strong evidence to support resveratrol for any use.","When taken by mouth : People often consume resveratrol in small amounts in foods. Resveratrol supplements are possibly safe when taken by mouth in doses up to 1500 mg daily for up to 3 months. Higher doses of up to 2000-3000 mg daily have been used safely for 2-6 months. But these higher doses are more likely to cause stomach upset. When applied to the skin : Resveratrol is possibly safe when used for up to 30 days. When sprayed into the nose : Resveratrol is possibly safe when used for up to 4 weeks. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Resveratrol is likely safe when used in amounts found in some foods. However, during pregnancy and breast-feeding, the source of resveratrol is important. Resveratrol is found in grape skins, grape juice, wine, and other food sources. Wine should not be used as a source of resveratrol when pregnant or breast-feeding. Children : People often consume resveratrol in small amounts in foods. But there isn't enough reliable information to know if it safe to take by mouth in larger amounts. Resveratrol is possibly safe in children when sprayed in the nose for up to 2 months. Bleeding disorders : Resveratrol might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding in people with bleeding disorders. Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Resveratrol might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use resveratrol. Surgery : Resveratrol might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using resveratrol at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Resveratrol acts as an antioxidant and inhibits LDL oxidation (21), platelet aggregation, and eicosanoid synthesis (4). It also induces nitric oxide production (24) (25) and increases arterial blood flow (8). These actions may contribute to its purported cardiovascular health benefits. Resveratrol acts as an anti-inflammatory agent by inhibiting cyclooxygenase activity (26). It has been shown to decrease C-reactive protein and tumor necrosis factor, and increase anti-inflammatory IL-10 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 in humans (5). Decreases in oxidative stress and improved insulin sensitivity may occur via increased protein kinase activities (10). Resveratrol also decreased circulating insulin-like growth factor-1 and IGF-binding protein-3 levels (27) which may account for its antidiabetic effects observed in some studies. Preliminary data suggest that it increases the life span of yeast cells by activating sirtuins (1) (2), and inhibiting human Sirt3 along with stimulating Sirt5 and Sirt1 (28). Neuroprotective effects may occur via regulating autophagy and apoptosis mediated by the Akt/mTOR pathway (51).
Resveratrol has also been investigated for its anticancer potential. It inhibited cancer cell proliferation via apoptosis and antiestrogenic effects (14) (15) (16) (17). Trans-resveratrol appears to decrease methylation of the tumor suppressor gene RASSF-1alpha in women at increased of risk breast cancer (29). Reductions in breast cancer cell migration and invasion have been observed (30) (31), and resveratrol growth factor heregulin-beta1 mediated MMP9 expression (30). However, contradictory data show that resveratrol mimics phytoestrogens and could activate genes that are normally regulated by estrogens or androgens (18) (19). In other studies resveratrol helped reduce prostate tumorigenesis through reduced prostatic levels of mTOR complex 1 activity and increased expression of SIRT1 (32). It modulates steroid hormone-dependent pathways to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth; however it also increases angiogenesis and inhibits apoptosis in vivo (19).
Additional findings show that resveratrol downregulates p21 and upregulates cyclin E leading to S-phase accumulation and apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells (14). It also inhibits CYP1A1, 1A2, and 1B1 enzymes in tumor cells, perhaps exerting antitumor effects as some of these enzymes are known to be involved in the activation of procarcinogens and toxins (22) (23). Protective effects of resveratrol against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity are due to upregulation of SIRT1-mediated p53 deacetylation (20). Also, it protects against cisplatin-induced cardiotoxicity by suppressing oxidative stress (19).","Vitis vinifera, Fruit |

DSI003377,Yeast,C0043392,"Brewer's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is used in beer brewing. It is sometimes used as a food additive and is also available as a dietary supplement. Some brewer's yeast products contain live yeast, while others contain non-living yeast. Brewer's yeast is a source of B vitamins and protein. It also contains chromium, which might help the body use insulin better and lower blood sugar levels. Brewer's yeast also seems to increase enzymes in the stomach that could relieve diarrhea and improve the body's defense against viral infections like the flu. People use brewer's yeast for diabetes, flu, diarrhea, high cholesterol, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Brewer's yeast is possibly safe for most people when taken short-term. A specific brewer's yeast product (EpiCor by Embria Health Sciences) that contains dried, non-living yeast has been safely used in doses of 500 mg daily for 12 weeks. Other brewer's yeast products that contain living yeast have been safely used in doses of 4-8 billion colony-forming units daily for up to 12 weeks. In some people, brewer's yeast can cause headache, stomach discomfort, and gas (flatulence). There isn't enough reliable information to know if brewer's yeast is safe to use long-term or what the side effects might be. Stick with short-term use.

DSI003389,Lavender,C0524903,"Derived from the flowering tops of the plant, lavender is used in lotions, perfumes, and in aromatherapy. It also has a long history as an herbal remedy in traditional medicine to improve mood and as a sleep aid. Preclinical data suggest anxiolytic , anticonvulsant , neuroprotective , cardioprotective , antimicrobial , anti-inflammatory , and antioxidant effects. In dementia models, lavender oil inhalation reversed spatial memory loss . Studies in humans of both oral formulas and lavender aromatherapy have been conducted. Clinical trials suggest benefit with oral lavender preparations against depression and anxiety . Studies of lavender aromatherapy suggest it may help reduce preoperative anxiety as well as postoperative analgesics and various types of pain , but it did not lower anxiety during radiotherapy . Other studies of inhaled lavender found improvements in sleep quality , post-acute-stress memory and physiologic function , dysmenorrhea and emotional symptoms , premenstrual syndrome , menopause flushing , migraine frequency , agitation and falls in older individuals and dementia symptoms . Various meta-analyses suggest benefit with either oral lavender or aromatherapy for anxiety and menopausal symptoms, but additional high-quality studies are needed to confirm safety and efficacy . Aromatherapy massage with lavender improved psychological and physiological responses in patients with acute coronary syndrome , but did not enhance the benefits of massage in a hospice setting . Preclinical studies suggest anticancer effects of lavender against various cancer cell lines . Animal studies that employed the monocyclic terpene perillyl alcohol (POH) derived from several herbs including lavender showed tumor inhibition and regression , but studies in humans are needed. | Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) is an evergreen plant native to the Mediterranean. Its flower and oil have a popular scent and are also used as medicine. Lavender contains an oil that seems to have calming effects and might relax certain muscles. It also seems to have antibacterial and antifungal effects. People commonly use lavender for anxiety, stress, insomnia, depression, dementia, pain, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. | Lavender cotton is a plant. The parts that grow above the ground and root bark are used to make medicine. People use lavender cotton for conditions such as digestion problems, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), infection of the intestines by parasites, and many others, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse lavender cotton with lavender. They are different plants and have very different scents.","When taken by mouth : Lavender is commonly consumed in foods. It's possibly safe when taken as medicine. Side effects might include constipation, diarrhea, and headache. When applied to the skin : Lavender is possibly safe. It's usually well-tolerated, but can sometimes cause skin irritation. When inhaled : Lavender essential oil is possibly safe. It's been used safely as aromatherapy for up to 12 weeks. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if lavender is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Lavender essential oil is possibly safe when inhaled as aromatherapy. But applying products that contain lavender oil to the skin is possibly unsafe for young males who haven't reached puberty. Lavender oil seems to have hormone-like effects that could disrupt normal hormones. In some cases, this has resulted in breast growth. There isn't enough reliable information to know if lavender is safe for children to take by mouth. Surgery : Lavender might slow down the central nervous system. If used with anesthesia and other medications given during and after surgery, it might slow down the central nervous system too much. Stop using lavender at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery. | When taken by mouth : There isn't enough reliable information to know if lavender cotton is safe. It might cause side effects such as allergic reactions in some people. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if lavender cotton is safe. It might cause side effects such as allergic reactions in some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if lavender cotton is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Allergy to ragweed, daisies, and related plants : Lavender cotton may cause an allergic reaction in people who are sensitive to the Asteraceae/Compositae plant family. Members of this family include ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many others. If you have allergies, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before taking lavender cotton.","Anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects of lavender are attributed to 1,8-cineole (2). Other major constituents include linalool and linalyl acetate, which may relax blood vessels and induce anxiolytic effects (30) (40) (54). In a murine model, exposure to linalool odor induced anxiolytic effects without motor impairment (77).
Lavender oil also has broad-spectrum antibacterial activity (22). It reversed bacterial resistance to piperacillin in multi-drug-resistant E.coli via alterations of outer membrane permeability and bacterial quorum sensing inhibition (27); and prevented immediate-type allergic reactions by inhibiting mast cell degranulation (25). Antimicrobial activity was synergistic or additive when combined with other essential oils, with the most favorable combinations being cinnamon or sweet orange oil against C. albicans and S. aureus, respectively (28).
In addition, lavender has CNS depressive effects (3). In animal models, it attenuated neuronal damage, and upregulated catalase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and the glutathione/glutathione disulfide ratio (21). Activity in stroke models include increased endogenous antioxidant defense, oxidative stress inhibition, and increased VEGF expression (33). In an Alzheimer’s disease model, lavender extract improved spatial performance by diminishing beta-amyloid production in the hippocampus (32). In mice with anosmia, anxiolytic effects with lavender inhalation were likely due to serotonergic mechanisms rather than olfactory activation (30) (31). However, whether lavender alleviates or exacerbates anxiety may actually be determined by genetic influences on temperament as these behaviors were amplified after exposure to lavender inhalation in calm versus nervous sheep (56). Antiepileptic effects are due to suppressed nitric oxide levels in the brain (26). Cardioprotective effects are attributed to lavender’s antioxidant properties (35). In wound healing models, lavender oil accelerated re-epithelialization and wound closure via enhanced epidermal growth factor secretion (55).
In young women with premenstrual syndrome, lavender inhalation increased the high frequency component of heart rate variability, reflecting parasympathetic nervous system activity (37). Although lavender reduced anxiety during urodynamic assessments by increasing gamma-aminobutyric acid inhibitory effects in the amygdala, blood pressure increases were attributed to potential diuretic activity (40). A positron emission tomography study revealed anxiolytic effects may occur via reduced serotonin-1A receptor binding (41). Effects on preoperative anxiety were attributed to both the use of lavender aroma as well as the placebo effect of added attention to patients (68).
An aqueous lavender extract inhibited lymphocyte proliferation in Hodgkin’s lymphoma cell lines via apoptosis (47). In addition, lavender extracts and essential oil exhibited cytotoxicity in malignant cells, upregulated Bax expression, and induced PARP cleavage in HeLa cells, and caused a sub-G1 peak in treated cells compared with controls (48). Perillyl alcohol (POH), derived from botanicals including lavender, may affect transforming growth factor-beta and/or Ras signaling pathways (59) and Na/K-ATPase inhibition (60).
Lavender oil has weak estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities that could alter estrogen and androgen signaling pathways (14).",Flower,"Aspic | Lavandin | Spike lavender | Alhucema, Common Lavender, English Lavender, French Lavender, Garden Lavender, Huile Essentielle de Lavande, Lavanda, Lavande, Lavande à Feuilles Étroites, Lavande Anglaise, Lavande Commune, Lavande des Alpes, Lavande du Jardin, Lavande Espagnole, Lavande Fine, Lavande Française, Lavande Officinale, Lavande Vraie, Lavandula, Lavandula angustifolia, Lavandula dentate, Lavandula latifolia, Lavandula officinalis, Lavandula pubescens, Lavandula spica, Lavandula stoechas, Lavandula vera, Lavender Essential Oil, Ostokhoddous, Spanish Lavender, Spike Lavender, True Lavender. | Abrótano Hembra, Brótano, Cipresillo, Fausse Sanguenitte, Garde-Robe, Guardarropa, Lavande-Coton, Petit Cyprès, Santolina, Santolina chamaecyparissus, Santoline, Santoline Argentée, Santoline Blanche, Santoline Petit-Cyprès, Santoline Petit Cyprès.",Lavendula angustifolia (Lavender) flower/leaf/stem,Lavender | Lavandula (unspecified),Lavender,Lavender | Lavender Cotton

DSI003458,Astragalus,C1095897,"Astragalus belongs to a group of medicinal plants in the Leguminosae family. The root of A. membranaceus has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), and is often used along with other herbs as a tonic to increase stamina, strength, and vitality. Extracts of astragalus are sold as dietary supplements to improve immune function and to decrease fatigue. Beneficial effects of astragalus are attributed to its polysaccharides and triterpenoid saponin compounds. Preclinical studies indicate that astragalus and its constituents have antioxidant , anti-inflammatory , and antiviral properties, along with exerting protective effects on the heart , kidney , bones , and the nervous system . In small studies involving healthy individuals, astragalus exhibited sodium-excreting properties ; produced a viral-type immune response ; and attenuated immune-suppression induced by strenuous physical activity . A formula containing astragalus decreased fatigue in athletes ; reduced diabetic ketoacidosis ; and as an adjuvant therapy, helped manage fatigue in stroke patients . In the injectable form, astragalus may benefit patients with IgA nephropathy . In addition, an astragalus-based formula was shown to preserve residual renal function in dialysis patients , and to reduce proteinuria associated with idiopathic membranous nephropathy . Systematic reviews reported benefits of astragalus as an adjunctive therapy for short-term reductions of albuminuria, proteinuria, and serum creatinine in patients with diabetic kidney disease ; and for improving quality of life in those with intracranial hemorrhage . Further research is needed to determine long-term safety and efficacy . Astragalus also showed anticancer effects against gastric , colon , hepatic and ovarian cancer cells, and concomitant treatment with aldesleukin potentiated tumoricidal activity while decreasing side effects . In addition, it enhanced platinum-based chemotherapy and protected against oxaliplatin neurotoxicity . Its saponins were shown to reverse fluorouracil-associated toxicity , and augmented benefits of vinblastine while reducing its neutropenic and anemic effects . Limited clinical data suggest astragalus may be useful in managing cancer-related fatigue . It has also been associated with prolonged survival times in acute myeloid leukemia patients ; and may help reverse chemo-induced immunosuppression along with reducing chemo-induced side effects . Meta-analyses have shown associations between astragalus and reductions in chemo-induced nausea and vomiting , chemo-induced gastrointestinal toxicity , radiation-induced lung injury and improvements in quality of life in patients with hepatocellular cancers . However, the majority of studies included in these analyses were limited by poor methodology. Larger, well-designed trials are needed to confirm the findings . Additionally, the injectable forms of astragalus were shown to improve clinical outcomes in liver cancer patients ; and quality of life in patients with advanced and metastatic cancers . Whether orally administered astragalus exerts similar effects is not known. Although astragalus is considered generally safe, due to its antioxidant and estrogenic activities, it may interfere with certain chemotherapy drugs and/or affect hormone-sensitive cancers. However, these findings are based on preclinical studies and cannot be extrapolated to clinical recommendations. The physiological concentration used in these studies is unlikely to be achieved in humans, which makes it difficult to predict the downstream effects/interactions. | Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) is a type of flowering plant. The root has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Astragalus is considered an adaptogen. Adaptogens are a class of natural substances that are believed to stimulate the body's resistance to physical, environmental, and emotional stressors. The chemicals in astragalus also seem to stimulate the immune system and reduce swelling. People commonly use astragalus for hay fever, diabetes, kidney disease, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using astragalus for COVID-19. There are many species of astragalus. Some species contain a nerve toxin and have been linked to livestock poisonings. These include Astragalus lentiginosus, Astragalus mollissimus, and others. But these species usually aren't found in dietary supplements. Most astragalus supplements contain Astragalus membranaceus. Also, don't confuse astragalus with tragacanth. These are different plants.","When taken by mouth : Astragalus is possibly safe for most adults. Doses of up to 60 grams daily have been safely used for up to 4 months. Astragalus is usually well-tolerated. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if astragalus is safe or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if astragalus is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. But some research in animals suggests that it can be toxic during pregnancy and to the fetus. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. ""Auto-immune diseases"" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other immune system conditions : Astragalus might make the immune system more active. This could worsen the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. Avoid using astragalus if you have any of these conditions.","Polysaccharides, triterpenoid saponins, and flavonoids are the main constituents of astragalus with immunomodulating, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer effects (27) (51). In vitro studies suggest the saponin astragaloside I promotes osteoblastic differentiation by regulating the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway (36). Cardioprotective effects from astragaloside IV may occur via the notch1/hes1 signaling pathway (30). In addition, it augments fibrinolytic potential via increases in tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) synthesis and downregulation of PA inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) (21). Other anticoagulant activities are attributed to upregulation of KLF2 mRNA expression and inhibition of NF-kB signaling pathway (52).
Polysaccharides isolated from astragalus produce immunomodulating effects via activation of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-related mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities (53). In murine models, they reduced colitis via inhibition of NOD-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome, which decreases inflammatory factors such as interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-1beta (54), and reduced multiorgan iron overload via upregulated hepcidin and IL-6 expression and enhanced p38 MAPK phosphorylation (55). Cardioprotective effects with this constituent were attributed to anti-inflammatory properties and improved balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and NO (32). In a diabetic rat model, astragalus polysaccharides exerted effects on glucose and lipid metabolism and insulin resistance (37). Astragalus was also found to reduce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines via increasing levels of CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ T cells and by inhibiting the activation of NF-κB (61).
Benefits to counteract memory disorders were seen with astragalus due to its activity as a nerve-growth promoting factor (17) and due to its ability to increase M-cholinergic receptor density in senile rats (11).
In dialysis patients, an astragalus-based TCM formula enhanced NO production and transforming growth factor beta suppression (40). In IgA nephropathy patients, an astragalus injection decreased Core I β3-Gal-T-specific molecular chaperone (Cosmc) gene expression and increased IgA1 O-glycosylation levels (26). In healthy individuals, a sublingual/ingested astragalus root extract produced increases in monocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and platelets, as well as circulating cytokines levels, and self-reported symptoms similar to viral type immune responses such as fatigue, malaise, and headache (38). In another study, a formula containing astragalus reduced fatigue in athletes by increasing the uptake and utility of oxygen (10).
Mechanisms by which astragalus and its constituents may exert anticancer effects have also been examined. In human colorectal cancers cell lines, astragalus suppressed chromosome organization, histone modification, and regulation of macromolecule metabolism, as well as several cancer signaling pathways (56). Saponins induced S phase and G2/M arrest and suppressed p21 expression and cyclin-dependent kinase activity (42). Modulation of mTOR signaling and COX2 downregulation also occurred, which in turn can reduce VEGF levels to suppress angiogenesis (43). In gastric adenocarcinoma cells, caspase 3 activation, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, cyclin B1, p21 and c-myc regulation, and downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 occurred (41). Combined with vinblastine, saponins boosted downregulation of proangiogenic and proliferative factors while attenuating neutropenia and anemia seen with this chemotherapy (44). In combination with calpain inhibitors, these saponins may also exert more pronounced apoptotic effects (45). Polysaccharides potentiate immune-mediated antitumor activity of interleukin-2 in vitro (13), improve lymphocyte responses, enhance natural killer cell activity, potentiate monocyte activity (14), increase phagocytosis perhaps by regulating tumor necrosis factor production (5), and activate macrophages to release nitric oxie and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, which directly blocks growth of breast cancer cells (62). Apoptotic effects by polysaccharides in hepatocellular carcimona cells were attributed to decreased Notch1 expression (46).
Formononetin derived from astragalus was shown to have estrogen-receptor-modulating effects (50). Angiogenic effects of astragaloside IV appear to be synergized when combined with ferulic acid from Angelica sinsensis (57).",Dried root(s) | Leaves,"Huang chi | Huang qi | Milk vetch | Radix astragali | Astragale, Astragale à Feuilles de Réglisse, Astragale Queue-de-Renard, Astragale Réglissier, Astragali, Astragalo, Astragalus Membranaceus, Astragalus mongholicus, Astragli Membranceus, Beg Kei, Bei Qi, Buck Qi, Chinese Astragalus, Huang Qi, Huang Se, Huangqi, Hwanggi, Membranous Milk Vetch, Membranous Milkvetch, Milk Vetch, Mongolian Milk, Mongolian Milkvetch, Ogi, Phaca membranacea, Radix Astragali, Radix Astragalus, Réglisse Bâtarde, Réglisse Sauvage.",Astragalus | Astragalus menziesii,Astragalus,Astragalus,Astragalus

DSI003519,Ginkgo,C0872895,"Ginkgo biloba is one of the oldest living tree species. It is cultivated around the world for its medicinal properties and aesthetic value. The seeds and leaves have been used in traditional Chinese medicine to treat respiratory diseases, circulatory disorders, sexual dysfunction, and hearing loss. It is also marketed as a supplement to support memory and circulation.Clinical studies including the large Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory (GEM) study generally show supplementation with ginkgo does not improve cognitive performance or prevent Alzheimer’s disease or dementia . In addition, positive effects from earlier studies were not confirmed in more recent trials and some systematic reviews determined there was insufficient evidence on any benefits in adults with either normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment .Although two trials suggest potential benefit with ginkgo in acute ischemic stroke , a study in older adults noted increased stroke incidence , and a meta-analysis suggests evidence is generally weak with a high risk of bias . In addition, the large GEM study did not find benefit with ginkgo for cardiovascular disease incidence or mortality . Studies on whether ginkgo can help tinnitus are mixed , as are studies for other conditions such as ADHD .Studies on ginkgo in cancer patients are quite limited , and secondary outcome data from the aforementioned GEM study does not support the use of ginkgo to reduce cancer risk . It is also ineffective in preventing chemotherapy-associated cognitive dysfunction in breast cancer patients .Although some preliminary data suggested ginkgo may reduce ovarian cancer risk , animal models suggest that high doses may have hepatocarcinogenic effects . More studies are needed to determine the significance of these findings. | Ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) is a large tree with fan-shaped leaves. The leaves are commonly included in supplements and taken by mouth for memory problems. The ginkgo tree is thought to be one of the oldest living trees, dating back more than 200 million years. It is native to China, Japan, and Korea, but is also now grown in Europe and the United States. It seems to improve blood circulation, and might also act as an antioxidant to slow down changes in the brain. Because ginkgo has been around for so long, people have used it for many purposes. It's commonly taken by mouth for memory and thought problems, anxiety, vision problems, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Ginkgo LEAF EXTRACT is likely safe for most people. It can cause some minor side effects such as stomach upset, headache, dizziness, and allergic skin reactions. There is also some concern that ginkgo leaf extract might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding or cause arrhythmia. The ROASTED SEED or CRUDE GINKGO PLANT are possibly unsafe when taken by mouth. Eating more than 10 roasted seeds daily can cause serious side effects such as seizures. Eating FRESH SEEDS may lead to death. They are poisonous and considered dangerous. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if ginkgo is safe. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Ginkgo is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. It might cause early labor or extra bleeding during delivery if used near that time. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if ginkgo is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Ginkgo leaf extract is possibly safe when taken by mouth for a short time. A specific combination of ginkgo leaf extract plus American ginseng might be safe in children when used short-term. Do not let children eat the ginkgo seed. The fresh seeds have caused seizures and death in children. Bleeding disorders : Ginkgo might make bleeding disorders worse. If you have a bleeding disorder, don't use ginkgo. Cross-reactivity : People who are allergic to poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac, mango rind, or cashew shell oil might also be allergic to ginkgo. Diabetes : Ginkgo might interfere with the management of diabetes. If you have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar closely. Seizures : Ginkgo might cause seizures. If you have ever had a seizure, don't use ginkgo. Deficiency of the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) : Ginkgo might cause severe anemia in people who have G6PD enzyme deficiency. Until more is known, use cautiously or avoid using ginkgo if you have G6PD deficiency. Infertility : Ginkgo use might interfere with getting pregnant. Discuss the use of ginkgo with your healthcare provider if you are trying to get pregnant. Surgery : Ginkgo might slow blood clotting. It might cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using ginkgo at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Ginkgo interacts with several cytochrome P450 enzymes. Pretreatment with G. biloba extract induces expression of CYP3A proteins and mRNA and increases CYP3A activity (26). It also inhibits CYP2B6 catalytic activity and bupropion hydroxylation (27). Ginkgo may play a role in decreasing high-glucose-induced endothelial inflammation via inhibition of interleukin-6 activation (28), and repeated intake of ginkgo enhanced cell proliferation and neuroblast differentiation (29). Flavonoids present in ginkgo extracts inhibited estrogen biosynthesis via aromatase inhibition, decreased CYP19 mRNA, and induced transcriptional suppression (30).Chemopreventive properties of bilobalide, a terpene trilactone, may occur via alterations in cryptal cell proliferation and drug-metabolizing enzyme activities (1). Exocarp polysaccharides from ginkgo affected expression of c-myc, bcl-2 and c-fos genes, which can inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis and differentiation of human gastric tumor cells (3).",Leaf | Leaf,"Fossil tree | Maidenhair tree | Kew tree | Bai guo ye | Yinhsing | Abricot Argenté Japonais, Adiantifolia, Arbre aux Écus, Arbre aux Quarante Écus, Arbre du Ciel, Arbre Fossile, Bai Guo Ye, Baiguo, Extrait de Feuille de Ginkgo, Extrait de Ginkgo, Fossil Tree, Ginkgo biloba, Ginkgo Biloba Leaf, Ginkgo Extract, Ginkgo Folium, Ginkgo Leaf Extact, Ginkgo Seed, Graine de Ginkgo, Herba Ginkgo Biloba, Japanese Silver Apricot, Kew Tree, Maidenhair Tree, Noyer du Japon, Pei Go Su Ye, Salisburia Adiantifolia, Yen Xing, Yinhsing.",Ginkgo | Ginkgo biloba leaf,Ginkgo Flavonglycosides | Ginkgo,Ginkgo,Ginkgo

In both TCM and Ayurveda, it is used in combination with isatis root and other herbs to treat the common cold, sore throat, mumps, respiratory ailments, other febrile diseases, hepatitis, and malignant tumors . Isatis root has both overlapping and different properties from isatis leaf. Isatis leaf is one of the ingredients used in PC-SPES, an herbal formula used to treat prostate cancer. It is also used in Danggui Longhui Wan, a formula used to treat chronic myelocytic leukemia in China . Preclinical studies indicate that isatis has antimicrobial, antiendotoxic , antiviral , immunostimulatory , anti-inflammatory , and chemotherapeutic properties. In several instances, the pharmacologic effects of isatis leaves were found to be greater than that of the roots . A preliminary study in healthy volunteers reported anti-inflammatory effects with use of topical isatis leaf. The pulverized form of isatis leaf, known as Qing Dai, has been used in small studies for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and showed benefit . However its use has also been associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension , so it should not be used outside of clinical trials. Additional studies are needed to determine safety and effectiveness. | Isatis root is derived from the isatis plant and is a source of indigo dye. In both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Ayurveda, it is used in combination with isatis leaf and other herbs to treat the common cold, sore throat, mumps, respiratory ailments, other febrile diseases, hepatitis, and malignant tumors . Chinese clinical practice guidelines weakly recommend Banlangen granules to treat mild influenza , and the formula Danggui Longhui Wan is used in China to treat chronic myelocytic leukemia . Isatis root has also been promoted to ward off SARS. In vitro assays have identified specific compounds in isatis root with potential anti-SARS and anti-influenza activity , as well as cytotoxic activity against human liver cancer and leukemia cell lines . Several in vitro and animal studies also demonstrate antimicrobial , antiviral , anti-endotoxic , immunostimulatory , chemotherapeutic , and radioprotective effects . Animal models indicate anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and antinociceptive effects . A small randomized study demonstrated utility of an isatis root extract solution to reduce severity of radiation mucositis, anorexia, and swallowing difficulty in head and neck cancer patients . Isatis leaf has both overlapping and different properties from isatis root. | Isatis (Isatis tinctoria) is a plant with small yellow flowers. It grows in China. The leaves and roots are used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Isatis may reduce fever and swelling. It also contains chemicals that might keep cancer cells from multiplying. People use isatis for aging skin, scaly itchy skin (psoriasis), diarrhea, prostate cancer, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.","When taken by mouth : There isn't enough reliable information to know if isatis is safe or what the side effects might be. When applied to the skin : Isatis is possibly safe when used appropriately, short-term. A specific product containing an isatis leaf extract called indigo naturalis in olive oil (Lindioil) has been used safely for 24 weeks. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if isatis is safe to use when pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Aspirin allergy : Isatis contains chemicals that are similar to the chemicals in aspirin. Isatis might trigger an asthma attack or an allergic reaction in people who are allergic to aspirin.","In vitro, isatis leaf inhibits COX-2 with preferential effects on COX-2–catalysed prostaglandin synthesis (10). The alkaloid tryptanthrin has been identified as the inhibitor of COX-2 (10) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) (13) (18). Indirubin, another active component, inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases and prevents proliferation by arresting cells in the G2/M phase (4). Other alkaloids isolated from isatis inhibit leukocyte function and attenuate production of mediators related to inflammatory responses (11). A compound derived from isatisine A showed moderate anti-HIV-1 activity (7), but better virucidal activity has been reported with the leaf, not root, extracts using a swine pseudorabies model (8).
Other animal models suggest that isatis leaf can reduce allergic airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness by inhibiting production of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5, and RANTES (9). And when used as post-exposure prophylaxis, isatis leaf attenuated lung tissue damage and reduced lung virus titers (6). Findings also showed induction of hepatocellular cancer cell death by isatis via a caspase-independent apoptotic pathway (12).
In other mechanistic studies, Qing Dai prevented bisphosphonate-induced gastrointestinal injury by suppressing mitochondrial ROS production, the main cause of cellular lipid peroxidation (27). Qing Dai may cause PAH via NO synthase inhibition and endothelial dysfunction in the pulmonary artery (32). | Isatis root exerts immunostimulatory effects by enhancing reticuloendothelial system function (11). Sinigrin and indigo are compounds responsible for potential SARS inhibition (4). Clemastanin B, a major lignan compound, targets viral endocytosis, uncoating, and nuclear export of viral ribonucleoproteins (5). A crude extract of isatis root prevented influenza virus attachment to cells and therefore viral replication, but was inactive against respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus, and enterovirus (19). Another component of isatis root demonstrates dose-dependent anti-endotoxic effects on lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of membrane-organizing extension spike protein, a main endotoxin receptor (10). Alkaloids isolated from isatis can inhibit leukocyte function and reduce inflammatory response (20). One animal study found that indigo root extract reduced tissue injury, enhanced hematopoietic system recovery, modulated serum inflammatory cytokines, and improved severe enteropathy in whole body irradiated mice (13).
In vitro, an ethanol extract of isatis root had a dose-dependent cytotoxic effect against HL-60 cells (9).

The anthraquinones and tannins in rhubarb are thought responsible for its laxative and constipating effects, respectively . In preclinical studies, rhubarb demonstrated anticancer , antimetastatic , radioprotective , and estrogen-receptor-modulating effects. The constituent aloe-emodin has demonstrated anticancer and anti-leishmanial properties, and appeared to enhance effects of sorefenib and cisplatin .

A few studies have also been conducted using topical applications. Short-term treatment with a rhubarb navel plaster improved bowel function in patients with chronic constipation . A small study of an externally applied mirabilite rhubarb powder along with chemotherapy suggests symptom improvement in patients with malignant pleural effusion . Additional studies to confirm safety and efficacy are needed. Rhubarb is considered to be a stimulant laxative and is high in oxalates . Animal studies suggest the potential for liver toxicity at high doses and with long-term use . Rhubarb is also a component of Essiac tea. Patients and physicians should be aware of the potential for additive effects. | Rhubarb (Rheum officinale) is a plant. Its stalk is commonly eaten. Its root and underground stem are used in traditional Chinese medicine combinations. Rhubarb contains chemicals that might help heal cold sores and reduce swelling. Rhubarb also contains fiber, which might help reduce cholesterol levels and affect stomach conditions. People use rhubarb for diarrhea, stomach pain, indigestion, symptoms of menopause, menstrual cramps, obesity, swelling of the pancreas, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Rhubarb stalk is commonly consumed as food. Rhubarb root and rhizome are possibly safe when taken in medicinal amounts for up to 2 years. Rhubarb stalk is possibly safe when taken in medicinal amounts for up to 4 weeks. It's usually well-tolerated. Side effects might include stomach pain, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and cramps. Rhubarb leaves are possibly unsafe. Rhubarb leaves contain oxalic acid, which can cause stomach pain, diarrhea, vomiting, seizures, and death. When applied to the skin : Rhubarb is possibly safe. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Rhubarb is commonly consumed in foods. Rhubarb is possibly unsafe when used in greater amounts. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts. Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions : Don't take rhubarb if you have a bowel obstruction, appendicitis, unexplained stomach pain, or inflammatory conditions such as Crohn disease, colitis, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Kidney disease : There are chemicals in rhubarb that might harm the kidneys or increase the risk of kidney stones. If you already have kidney disease, avoid rhubarb. Kidney stones : Rhubarb contains a chemical that the body can convert into kidney stones. If you have ever had kidney stones, don't take rhubarb. Liver problems : Rhubarb can make liver function worse in people who already have liver problems. People who have liver problems should avoid rhubarb.","When used in small doses, the tannin content in rhubarb has a constipating effect. At higher doses, however, the hydrolyzed metabolites of emodin and sennidin stimulate the gastrointestinal tract and produce a laxative effect (4). The actions of anthraquinones on rheinanthrone, which is transformed from sennoside A, may promote the purgative effects of sennoside A (16).
The anti-inflammatory activity of emodin may mediate rhubarb’s hepatoprotective effects in rats with cholestatic hepatitis (11). Lindeyin, a phenolic gallylglucoside, exhibits analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties in animal models. Catechin, epicatechin, procyanidins, and gallylglucose were shown to inhibit hyaluronidase (10) (12).
Additional studies suggest that aloe-emodin exerts anti-proliferative activity, inducing cell cycle arrest in cancer cell lines (6). Anthraquinone extracts of rhubarb induced cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines (5) and tumor necrosis in mice (1), although this has not been demonstrated in humans. Another study showed that emodin inhibits human cancer cell invasiveness by specifically antagonizing the adenosine 5’-triphosphate-gated Ca(2+)-permeable channel P2X7 receptor (17).
Other animal studies suggest potential for liver toxicity at high doses and with long-term use, in part due to anthraquinone compounds such as rhein and emodin as well as tannins (40).",Root | Root,"Turkish rhubarb | Chinese rhubarb | Tai huang | Da huang | Chinese Rhubarb, Da Huang, Garden Rhubarb, Himalayan Rhubarb, Indian Rhubarb, Medicinal Rhubarb, Radix et Rhizoma Rhei, Rewandchini, Rhapontic Rhubarb, Rhei, Rhei Radix, Rheum australe, Rheum emodi, Rheum officinale, Rheum palmatum, Rheum rhaponticum, Rheum tanguticum, Rhubarbe, Rhubarbe de Chine, Rhubarbe Indienne, Rhubarbe Médicinale, Rhubarbe Palmée, Rhubarbe Potagère, Rhubarbe Turque, Ruibarbo, Siberian Rhubarb, Tai Huang, Turkey Rhubarb.",Rhubarb | Rheum rhabarbarum,Himalayan Rhubarb | Indian Rhubarb (herb powder) | Indian Rhubarb | Rhubarb (unspecified) | Rhubarb,Rhubarb,Rhubarb

A major component of olive leaf, oleuropein, has been shown to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity . Because of its hypoglycemic effects, the leaf extract can induce insulin release and improve peripheral uptake of glucose . It also has antimicrobial , anti-HIV , and anticancer properties. Animal studies showed antiarrhythmic, spasmolytic, diuretic , antihypertensive , analgesic , and cholesterol-lowering effects.

There isn't enough reliable information to know if olive is safe to use as medicine when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts.,"The cholesterol-lowering effects of olive leaf extracts (OLE) are thought to be due to oleuropein, a compound present in the leaves. Studies on hypercholesterolemic rats suggest that OLE is more effective than pure oleuropein at lowering cholesterol. This implies that a synergistic effect occurs between oleuropein and another substance within the leaf (7).
Oleuropein is converted into elenoic acid in the body which may prevent viruses and bacteria from replicating (8). The antihypertensive and vasodilating effects of olive leaf occurred independently of the integrity of the vascular endothelium (9). Constituents of olive leaf have been shown to strongly inhibit the complement system, although it is unknown what effect this has on the body (10).
Hypoglycemic activities of olive leaf are attributed to two mechanisms: potentiation of glucose-induced insulin release and increased peripheral uptake of glucose. Hypoglycemic activity is greater in samples collected in the winter months (2). OLE may prevent diabetic neuropathy by reducing glucose-induced apoptosis through the inhibition of neural caspase 3 activation (20).
In vitro studies show that OLE has antimicrobial activities against E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, T. rubrum, and Candida albicans (3) (22). Anti-HIV properties of OLE include upregulation of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor proteins as well as protein kinase signaling molecules (4).

When applied to the skin, it can cause surface warmth, which relieves pain beneath the skin. It may also help to ""cool"" the skin and relieve itching. People use peppermint for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is also used for indigestion, bed sores, tension headache, anxiety, insomnia, memory, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. Don't confuse peppermint with other mint plants, such as English Horsemint, Japanese Mint, Perilla, Salvia divinorum, Spearmint, and Wild Mint. These are different plants.","When taken by mouth : Peppermint oil is likely safe. Peppermint leaf is possibly safe when taken for up to 8 weeks. It's not clear if peppermint leaf is safe to use for longer than 8 weeks. Peppermint can cause some side effects including heartburn, dry mouth, nausea, and vomiting. When applied to the skin : Peppermint oil is likely safe. When given as an enema (rectally) : Peppermint oil is likely safe. When inhaled : Peppermint oil is possibly safe when used as part of aromatherapy. When applied into the nose : There isn't enough reliable information to know if peppermint oil is safe or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding :  Peppermint is commonly consumed in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if peppermint is safe to use in larger amounts while pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts. Children :  Peppermint is commonly consumed in foods. Peppermint oil is possibly safe in children 8 years of age and older when taken by mouth in pills with a special (enteric) coating to prevent contact with the stomach. Diarrhea : Taking peppermint oil could cause burning with diarrhea.","Peppermint oil relieves gastrointestinal symptoms likely by regulating calcium channel-dependent processes within the gastric, intestinal, and colonic systems. Both peppermint oil and menthol, a major ingredient in peppermint, produce antispasmodic effects in these systems by diminishing calcium influx (6) (8) (18). Studies using murine models have shown that menthol improves body weight gain, mean macroscopic and microscopic ulcer scores, attenuates lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress and inflammation in acetic acid-induced colitis (49); essential oil of peppermint demonstrated antidiabetic effects in streptozotocin-nicotinamide-induced type 2 diabetes by upregulating the expression of Bcl-2 and insulin (47), along with attenuating hepatic fibrosis by improving the redox status, suppressing p53 and modulating TGF-beta1 and SMAD3 protein expression (48).Flavonoids in peppermint have antioxidant activity that may protect cells from radiation damage (12). Menthol has also been reported to induce PC-3 prostate cancer cell death by activating c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (19).",Leaf/Leaves | Peppermint is used as flavoring agent in some foods and candy.,"Balm mint | Japanese peppermint | Lamb mint | Our Lady's mint | Black Peppermint, Brandy Mint, Extract of Mentha Piperita, Extract of Peppermint, Extract of Peppermint Leaves, Extract of Peppermint Leaves, Extrait de Feuilles de Menthe de Poivrée, Extrait de Mentha Piperita, Extrait de Menthe Poivrée, Feuille de Menthe Poivrée, Field Mint, Herba Menthae, Huile de Mentha Piperita, Huile de Menthe Poivrée, Huile Essentielle de Menthe Poivrée, Lamb Mint, M.

In vitro studies report that ellagic acid protects cells from oxidative DNA damage caused by hydrogen peroxide and bleomycin (8). Ellagic acid’s ability to induce detoxification enzymes NADPH and quinone reductase contribute to some of its chemopreventive activities (13).

DSI003894,Mistletoe,C0331018,"Mistletoe is a semi-parasitic plant that grows on various host trees. Mistletoe extracts are used for a variety of conditions including cancer, HIV, hepatitis, and degenerative joint disease. Oral preparations are available as dietary supplements and homeopathic remedies. However, most clinical research has evaluated mainly parenteral formulations, which are not approved for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration. Studies support the use of mistletoe to improve symptoms and quality of life, and reduce chemotherapy and radiotherapy side effects, including in pancreatic , lung , colorectal , and breast cancers. Some studies suggest it may help prolong survival , but other study results are mixed . Preliminary studies suggest that intravesical mistletoe extract is safe and well tolerated in patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer , and that mistletoe extract injection may be efficacious for chemical pleurodesis in patients with malignant pleural effusion . In two studies with 5-year follow-ups of breast cancer patients, mistletoe did not appear to negatively influence chemotherapy efficacy and affected reductions in persistent symptoms . In patients with advanced solid tumors, the addition of mistletoe allowed for higher gemcitabine doses to be used without apparent pharmacokinetic interactions . Concomitant mistletoe appeared to reduce adverse events from monoclonal antibody therapy but not immune checkpoint inhibitors . Benefits with mistletoe treatment in combination with medical care have also been reported . Large prospective studies are needed to determine safety and whether these immune-related events translate to beneficial outcomes. Raw mistletoe contains toxic constituents. Possible adverse effects from mistletoe treatment include injection site reactions, chills, and fever . Long-term use may also reduce T-cell function in cancer patients , but the majority of reactions were mild to moderate and dose-related . Mistletoe inhibits CYP3A4 in vitro, so it could theoretically interact with drugs metabolized by this enzyme. However, this effect only happens in very high doses and is unlikely when used in clinically relevant concentrations . | European mistletoe (Viscum album) is a plant that grows on several different trees throughout the world. The berry, leaf, and stem are used as medicine. European mistletoe contains chemicals that might stimulate the immune system and kill certain cancer cells, but it's not clear if these effects occur in the human body. People use European mistletoe for various types of cancer, including head and neck cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Most research has evaluated European mistletoe injections given by a healthcare provider. There is very little research on the use of European mistletoe taken by mouth.","When taken by mouth : European mistletoe is possibly safe when used appropriately. But taking more than three berries or two leaves is likely unsafe and can cause serious side effects, including vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, and liver damage. Do not take European mistletoe without the advice of your healthcare professional. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : European mistletoe is likely unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. It might stimulate the uterus and cause a miscarriage. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if European mistletoe is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. ""Auto-immune diseases"" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions : European mistletoe might cause the immune system to become more active. This could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using European mistletoe. Leukemia : European mistletoe might make leukemia worse. If you have leukemia, don't take European mistletoe. Organ transplant : European mistletoe might make the immune system more active. A more active immune system might increase the risk of organ rejection. If you have had an organ transplant, avoid European mistletoe. Surgery : European mistletoe might affect blood pressure. This might interfere with blood pressure control during and after surgery. Stop taking European mistletoe at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","In preclinical models, mistletoe has anti-inflammation (1) and anticancer effects (3) (4) (51). Mistletoe lectins are the most investigated single component of mistletoe extracts, with cytotoxic effects attributed in part to ribosome-inactivating properties and apoptotic induction (5). In vitro studies show that lectins induce macrophage cytotoxicity, stimulate immune-cell phagocytosis, increase TNFα, IL-1, IL-2, and IL-6 cytokine secretion, and enhance cytotoxicity (29). In lymphoblastic leukemia cells, mistletoe extracts stimulate dendritic cell maturation and activation (30) and induce dose-dependent apoptosis through caspase-8 and -9 dependent pathways (26).
In animal models, triterpene-containing mistletoe extracts produced the greatest apoptotic induction (26) and improved efficacy against malignant melanoma compared with conventional extracts via reduced tumor angiogenesis (31). Viscotoxins may also be responsible for tumor-inhibiting and immune-stimulating activities (28). However, mistletoe produced both pro- and anti-proliferative effects depending on dose (32).
Mistletoe preparations induce T-helper 2 immune response, as evidenced by significant eosinophilia during treatment in patients with chronic hepatitis C (2). Mistletoe-induced immune stimulation may explain physical improvements that contribute to increased quality of life in cancer patients (5).",Plant with berries,"Viscum | All-heal | Birdlime | White-berry mistletoe | All-Heal, Banda, Birdlime Mistletoe, Blandeau, Bois de Sainte-Croix, Bouchon, Devil's Fuge, Drudenfuss, Eurixor, Guérit-Tout, Gui, Gui Blanc, Gui Blanc d'Europe, Gui des Feuillus, Gui d'Europe, Gui Européen, Helixor, Herbe de Chèvre, Hexenbesen, Hurchu, Iscador, Isorel, Leimmistel, Mistlekraut, Mistletein, Mistletoe, Muérdago Europeo, Mystyldene, Nid de Sorcière, Pain de Biques, Rini, Verquet, Vert-Bois, Vert de Pommier, Visci, Visci Albi Folia, Visci Albi Fructus, Visci Albi Herba, Visci Albi Stipites, Vogelmistel, Vysorel, Viscum album.",Mistletoe,Chinese Mistletoe | European Mistletoe | Mistletoe (unspecified),Mistletoe (European),European Mistletoe

Bismuth salts seem to help eliminate bacteria that cause stomach problems such as diarrhea and stomach ulcers. Bismuth salts also work like an antacid to treat problems such as indigestion. Bismuth might also speed up blood clotting. People commonly use bismuth for travelers' diarrhea, a digestive tract infection that can lead to ulcers (Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori), and stomach ulcers. It is also used for constipation, bleeding, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these other uses. Bismuth supplements are available in many different salt forms. Bismuth nitrate is a specific form that is not legal for use in dietary supplements. Review the listing on bismuth nitrate for more details. | Bismuth nitrate is a salt. It contains the heavy metal bismuth. People use bismuth nitrate for preventing kidney damage caused by cancer drugs, for preventing bone marrow damage caused by radiation, and for a digestive tract infection that can lead to ulcers (Helicobacter pylori or H. pylori), but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Bismuth nitrate is used in cosmetics as a pigment. In December 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration added bismuth nitrate to the Dietary Supplement Ingredient Advisory List. The ingredients on this list might not be lawful to include in dietary supplements. For this reason, people may want to avoid using supplements containing bismuth nitrate. Do not confuse bismuth nitrate with other bismuth salts. See separate listing for bismuth.","When taken by mouth : Bismuth subgallate and bismuth subsalicylate are likely safe for most people when used as directed. Other forms of bismuth salts are possibly safe when used short-term. Bismuth salts, including ranitidine bismuth citrate, colloidal bismuth subcitrate, and bismuth subnitrate appear to be safe when taken in doses of 400-2100 mg daily for up to 56 days. Bismuth is possibly unsafe when used in larger amounts due to the risk for kidney failure, and when taken long-term due to the risk of nerve damage. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if bismuth is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Bismuth subgallate and bismuth subsalicylate are likely safe when taken by mouth short-term. Taking 200-400 mg of bismuth subgallate by mouth up to four times daily is approved by the US FDA as a deodorant drug for children at least 12 years old. Taking 1.05 grams of bismuth subsalicylate by mouth hourly as needed (no more than 4.2 grams daily) for up to 2 days is approved by the US FDA for diarrhea in children at least 12 years old. There isn't enough reliable information to know if it is safe for children to take other bismuth salts. Bismuth is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in large amounts or long-term. Allergy to salicylate : Many bismuth supplements contain the bismuth salt called bismuth subsalicylate. Bismuth subsalicylate breaks down in the stomach to form bismuth and salicylate. People who are sensitive to salicylate might have a serious side effect to these supplements. Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions : Normally, almost no bismuth is absorbed by the gut.

DSI003993,Passiflora,C0330470,"Passiflora incarnata is a perennial wildflower that is prevalent in the southern United States. Its extracts are used in supplemental forms to treat insomnia, anxiety, epilepsy, neuralgia, and withdrawal syndromes associated with opiates or benzodiazepines. It is also found in over-the-counter preparations to reduce symptoms associated with menopause and hyperactivity. Animal models suggest antidiabetic , antiasthmatic , and seizure suppression effects . Passionflower also reduced seizure severity, immobility, and retained brain levels of serotonin and noradrenaline . In another study, its extracts were shown to produce anxiogenic effects, although two of these extracts also showed an anticonvulsant effect against seizures . A pilot study of passionflower for generalized anxiety showed comparable efficacy to oxazepam and a systematic review determined it may improve symptoms associated with neuropsychiatric disorders . In patients undergoing surgery , and dental extractions , preoperative use of passionflower was reported to reduce anxiety. In healthy adults, consumption of a low-dose passionflower tea produced short-term benefits in sleep quality . Another study showed passionflower had comparable effects to a prescription drug for the treatment of ADHD . When used concurrently, passionflower was shown to enhance the pharmacologic effects of St. John’s wort . | Passion flower (Passiflora incarnata) is a climbing vine with white and purple flowers. The chemicals in passion flower have calming effects. Passion flower is native to the southeastern United States and Central and South America. It's been traditionally used to help with sleep. People use passion flower for anxiety, including anxiety before surgery. Some people also take passion flower for insomnia, stress, ADHD, pain, and many other conditions. But there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. In some foods and beverages, passion flower is added for flavoring.","When taken by mouth : Passion flower is likely safe for most people when used as a flavoring in foods. It's possibly safe when taken as a tea for 7 nights, or as a medicine for up to 8 weeks. It may cause side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness, and confusion. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if passion flower is safe or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Passion flower is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. It might lead to early labor and other problems. There are some chemicals in the passion flower plant that might cause the uterus to contract. Don't use passion flower if you are pregnant. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if passion flower is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Passion flower is possibly safe for most children when taken by mouth for short periods of time. A specific passion flower product (Pasipay by Iran Darouk Pharmaceutical Company) has been used safely in children aged 6-13 years for up to 8 weeks. Surgery : Passion flower might slow down the nervous system. Anesthesia and other medications used before and after surgery can also slow down the nervous system. Taking them together might slow down the nervous system too much. Talk to your healthcare provider if you are taking passion flower within 2 weeks of a scheduled surgery.","The alkaloid constituents harman and harmaline are thought to produce monoamine oxidase inhibition (1), while maltol and gamma-pyrone derivatives cause activation of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) receptors that may account for anxiolytic and sedative properties (11). Chrysin has also been identified among the bioactive metabolites with central nervous system (CNS) suppression activity (21).
In vitro, modulation of the GABA system by passionflower includes affinity to GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptors, and effects on GABA uptake (24). Antiradical activities observed are attributed to flavonoids such as isovitexin (25). An isolated benzoflavone moiety is suspected as being the strongest aromatase inhibitor in passionflower, although the flavone chrysin also has these properties (26).
In an animal reproductive and developmental study, passionflower produced sexual behavioral disruption in male adult rats that was not accompanied by alterations in plasma testosterone levels, reproductive-related organs, and glands weights or sperm count, and was potentially attributed to aromatase inhibition (27). In seizure models, protection against post-ictal depression not seen with diazepam controls point to activity from metabolites in passionflower rather than as a result of its seizure suppression effects (21).
Passionflower also exhibits mild anti-inflammatory activity. An ethanolic extract of passionflower reduced carrageenan-induced edema, leukocyte migration, and granuloma formation in mice, although the effect was less than that seen with aspirin (13).",Herb top | Fruit,"Maypop | Apricot vine | Passion vine | Passiflore | Apricot Vine, Burucuya, Corona de Cristo, Fleischfarbene, Fleur de la Passion, Fleur de Passiflore, Flor de Passion, Granadilla, Grandilla, Grenadille, Madre Selva, Maracuja, Maracuya, Maypop, Maypop Passion Flower, Pasiflora, Pasionari, Pasionaria, Passiflora, Passiflora incarnata, Passiflorae Herba, Passiflore, Passiflore Aubépine, Passiflore Officinale, Passiflore Purpurine, Passiflore Rouge, Passiflorina, Passion Vine, Passionaria, Passionblume, Passionflower, Passionflower Herb, Passionsblomma, Passionsblumenkraut, Purple Passion Flower, Water Lemon, Wild Passion Flower.",Passiflora | Passiflora Edulis,Passiflora (unspecified) | Passionflower,Passionflower,Passion Flower

DSI004057,Bupleurum,C0873146,"Bupleurum is an important herb used in traditional Chinese and Japanese medicine. It is frequently prescribed in combination with other herbs to treat colds, fever, malaria, digestive disorders, chronic liver diseases, and depression. Herbal formulas such as Xiao Chai Hu Tang (Sho-saiko-to) and Xiao Yao San contain bupleurum as a major ingredient. Preclinical studies suggest that bupleurum has antiviral , hepatoprotective , anti-inflammatory , immune-modulating , antiproliferative , and chemopreventive properties. Experiments suggest bupleurum might exert some influence over multidrug resistance in drug-resistant cells . Saikosaponins, a major constituent, enhanced cisplatin cytotoxicity against solid tumors . In animal studies, bupleurum demonstrated inhibitory effects against allergic asthma . Experiments in both chronic mildly stressed and healthy rats describe differential effective and toxic responses . Saikosaponins were identified as the compound which may be responsible for bupleurum-induced liver injury . Studies of bupleurum in humans are lacking. Although a meta-analysis suggests Bupleurum chinense herbal formulas may help reduce depression severity, the evidence was considered to be of low quality . Poor quality control is also a concern with commercial herbal products. A sample of bupleurum was found contaminated with a nephrotoxic drug, aristolactone . In addition, the extent to which bupleurum is screened for levels of toxic compounds such as polyacetylenes in general is unclear . | Bupleurum is an herb or woody shrub native to Europe, Asia, and North America. There are about 200 different species. Its root is used as medicine. Bupleurum is included in many Chinese and Japanese traditional herbal formulas. It might help stimulate the immune system and protect the liver. People use bupleurum for asthma, depression, flu, hepatitis, liver cancer, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Bupleurum is possibly safe. It's been used as part of a Japanese herbal formula called Sho-saiko-to for up to 5 years. It's usually well-tolerated. Side effects might include nausea. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if bupleurum is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Auto-immune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions : Bupleurum might cause the immune system to become more active. This could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using bupleurum. Bleeding disorders : Chemicals in bupleurum might slow blood clotting. This might make bleeding disorders worse. Diabetes : Chemicals in bupleurum might increase blood sugar levels. Monitor your blood sugar carefully if you have diabetes and use bupleurum. The dose of your diabetes medication may need to be changed. Surgery : Chemicals in bupleurum might prolong bleeding or increase blood sugar levels. Stop taking saikosaponins at least two weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Saikosaponins in bupleurum are the main constituent to which medicinal activities are attributed. In vitro studies indicate they exert anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting arachidonic acid metabolism (4). Bupleurum polysaccharides also have anti-inflammatory properties, attributed to their inhibitory effect on LPS-mediated Toll like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling (17). Immunoregulatory activity of saikosaponin-d has been related to the promotion of interleukin-2 production and receptor expression as well as modulating T-lymphocyte function (3) (14). However, saikosaponins were also identified as the compound which may be responsible for dose-dependent bupleurum-induced liver injury (22).
Apoptotic effects of bupleurum may be partly mediated by increased c-myc and p53 mRNA levels along with decreased bcl-2 mRNA levels (6), and by inhibition of telomerase activity (9). In some solid tumor cells, bupleurum demonstrated antiadhesive and hemolytic effects (5) (8).",Root,"Chai Hu | Hare's ear root | Thorowax root | Saiko | Bei Chai Hu, Bupleuri, Bupleurum Chinese, Bupleurum chinense, Bupleurum exaltatum, Bupleurum falcatum, Bupleurum fruticosum, Bupleurum longifolium, Bupleurum multinerve, Bupleurum octoradiatum, Bupleurum rotundifolium, Bupleurum scorzonerifolium, Buplèvre, Buplèvre Chinois, Buplèvre à Feuilles Rondes, Buplèvre à Feuilles de Scorsonère, Buplèvre à Longues Feuilles, Buplèvre Ligneux, Chai Hu, Chi Hu, Chinese Bupleurum, Chinese Thoroughwax, Hare's Ear Root, Radix Bupleuri, Saiko, Shrubby Hare's-ear, Sickle-leaf Hare's-ear, Thoroughwax, Thorow wax.",Bupleurum,Bupleurum | Bupleurum (unspecified),Bupleurum,Bupleurum

DSI004181,Licorice,C0017987,"Derived from the root of the plant, licorice is used to flavor foods. It is also used in traditional Chinese medicine to detoxify and enhance or balance the effects of other components in herbal formulations. In Ayurveda, licorice is used as a tonic, an expectorant, and as a demulcent. A number of compounds including glycyrrhizin are thought to be responsible for its biological effects. Licorice supplements are promoted for menopausal symptoms, digestive issues, cough, and bacterial and viral infections. Preclinical findings indicate antibacterial , antiviral , anticancer , anti-inflammatory , and hepatoprotective effects. Licorice also demonstrated estrogenic effects , reduced cardiotoxicity associated with doxorubicin , and improved the antitumor effects of cyclophosphamide .Clinical data suggest benefits in lowering dyspepsia and hyperlipidemia . Concurrent intake of a glycyrrhizin-containing product during alcohol consumption was found to have hepatoprotective effects . Licorice along with weight loss and lifestyle modification was found superior to lifestyle modification alone for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease . When combined with fermented milk containing Lactobacillus paracasei, licorice reduced bacterial density and improved histologic inflammation in patients with H. pylori infection ; and preoperative gargling with a licorice solution reduced postoperative sore throat compared to gargling with sugar water . Licorice also accelerated healing in patients with second-degree burns . Systematic reviews have confirmed benefits of topical licorice in preventing postoperative sore throat .Licorice use also improved symptoms in patients with Parkinson’s disease suggestive of neuroprotective effects . When used as a mouthwash, it prevented dental caries ; improved xerostomia in hemodialysis patients ; and as a mucoadhesive film, was useful against oral mucositis during radiotherapy . A systematic review and meta analysis found herbal formulas containing licorice to alleviate chemo-induced gastrointestinal toxicity in patients with colorectal cancer .Of note, chronic ingestion of even moderate doses of licorice has been associated with hypertension and hypokalemia . | Licorice is an herb that grows in parts of Europe and Asia. Licorice root contains glycyrrhizin, which can cause side effects when eaten in large amounts. The chemicals in licorice are thought to decrease swelling, decrease cough, and increase the chemicals in our body that heal ulcers. Many ""licorice"" products made in the U.S. actually don't contain licorice. They contain anise oil, which has the smell and taste of ""black licorice"". Licorice is used for eczema, swelling of the liver, mouth sores, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using licorice for COVID-19.","When taken by mouth : Licorice is likely safe for most people when eaten in typical food amounts. Licorice that has had the chemical glycyrrhizin removed is possibly safe when taken in doses up to 4.5 grams daily for up to 4 months. Licorice that contains glycyrrhizin is possibly unsafe when consumed in large amounts or for a long time. Eating licorice 5 grams or more daily for several weeks can cause severe side effects including heart attack. People who have heart disease, kidney disease, or high blood pressure are more sensitive to it. Ingesting large amounts of licorice from candy, lozenges, or tea might also cause serious side effects. When applied to the skin : Applying gel with licorice root extract 2% is possibly safe for up to 2 weeks. It is possibly safe to use a licorice mouth rinse for up to one week. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : It is unsafe to take licorice when pregnant. It might cause a miscarriage or early delivery. Eating about 250 grams of licorice per week seems to increase the risk of early delivery. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information available about the safety of taking licorice when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Heart conditions : Licorice can cause the body to store water, and this can make heart failure worse. Licorice can also increase the risk of irregular heartbeat. Don't consume licorice if you have a heart condition. Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Licorice might act like estrogen in the body. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use licorice. High blood pressure : Licorice can raise blood pressure. Don't consume large amounts of licorice if you have high blood pressure. A muscle condition caused by nerve problems (hypertonia) : Licorice can lower potassium levels in the blood. This can make hypertonia worse. Avoid licorice if you have hypertonia. Low potassium levels in the blood (hypokalemia) : Licorice can lower potassium levels in the blood. If your potassium is already low, licorice might make it too low. Don't use licorice if you have this condition. Kidney disease : Consuming large amounts of licorice could make kidney disease worse. Sexual problems : Consuming large amounts of licorice can lower interest in sex. It can also worsen erectile dysfunction (ED) by lowering levels of testosterone. Surgery : Licorice might interfere with blood pressure control during and after surgery. Stop taking licorice at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Glycyrrhizin, one of the bioactive compounds of licorice, can bind to glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid receptors, and exert its effects via inhibition of 11b-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (12). Licorice can reduce serum testosterone by inhibiting 17-hydroxysteriod dehydrogenase (35) (36). It also contains isoflavones and other constituents that have estrogen receptor-modulating activities (10). The flavone and liquiritigenin components selectively activate ER-beta (11).Animal studies suggest liquiritigenin may have neuroprotective effects via increasing expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and cAMP response element binding in the hippocampus (55). Glycyrrhizic acid, a triterpene glycoside, demonstrated anti-allergic properties by restoring the immune balance of subsets 1 and 2 of T-helper cells in a dose-dependent manner. It also reduced B cells producing allergen-specific IgE and IgG1 (56).Licorice demonstrated chemopreventive effects by modulating expression of Bcl-2/Bax proteins, which act as apoptotic regulatory factors (3), and via inhibiting carcinogenesis (4). Other mechanisms include inducing apoptosis in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells by regulation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway (60), and by modulating cyclin B1-CDK1 for G2/M arrest in prostate cancer cells (61).The most common side effect of licorice is hypokalemic hypertension, which occurs secondary to inhibition of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, a renal enzyme responsible for converting cortisol to cortisone. This inhibition results in enhancing the mineralocorticoid effects of cortisol (36) that include sodium retention and potassium excretion.",Stolons,"Gan cao | Sweet root | Glycyrrhiza | Liquorice | Acide Glycyrrhizique, Acide Glycyrrhizinique, Alcacuz, Alcazuz, Bois Doux, Bois Sucré, Can Cao, Chinese Licorice, Deglycyrrhized Licorice, East European Licorice, Gan Cao, Gan Zao, Glabra, Glycyrrhiza, Glycyrrhiza echinate, Glycyrrhiza glabra, Glycyrrhiza glabra typica, Glycyrrhiza glabra violacea, Glycyrrhiza glabra glandulifera, Glycyrrhiza glandulifera, Glycyrrhiza Radix, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Glycyrrhizae, Glycyrrhizic Acid, Glycyrrhizinic Acid, Isoflavone, Jethi-Madh, Kanzo, Lakritze, Licorice Root, Liquiritiae Radix, Liquirizia, Mulathi, Mulethi, Orozuz, Phytoestrogen, Phyto-œstrogène, Racine de Réglisse, Racine Douce, Radix Glycyrrhizae, Régalissse, Regaliz, Reglisse, Réglisse, Réglisse Déglycyrrhisée, Réglisse Espagnole, Réglisse Russe, Regliz, Russian Licorice, Spanish Licorice, Subholz, Sussholz, Sweet Root, Turkish Licorice, Ural Licorice, Yashtimadhu, Yashti-Madhu, Yashti-Madhuka, Zhi Gan Cao.",Licorice,Licorice (unspecified) | Licorice | Licorice (various),Licorice,Licorice

DSI004194,Kombucha,C5785465,"Kombucha is a beverage made by fermenting sweetened black tea (green and oolong tea are also used) with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeasts (SCOBY). Believed to have originated in China, kombucha has gained worldwide popularity as a functional food. The SCOBY consists of several acetic acid and lactic acid bacteria. Following fermentation, kombucha’s chemical makeup includes sugars, tea polyphenols, fiber, ethanol, amino acids and water-soluble vitamins . Health benefits attributed to kombucha include reduction of blood pressure and cholesterol along with anticancer and immunostimulatory effects. Preclinical studies have shown anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunostimulatory , hypolipidemic , and hepatoprotective effects with limited toxicity . In a small study involving 24 subjects with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, daily intake of kombucha was associated with normalized blood sugar values . Randomized studies have yet to be conducted . Kombucha is used as an immunostimulant, and to treat diabetes, cancer and AIDS . The high caffeine and sugar content of the tea may account for increase in energy levels following its consumption . However, kombucha can be easily contaminated during fermentation. Allergic reactions, jaundice, serious illness, and death have been associated following consumption of home-grown kombucha . It may also reduce the absorption of drugs that are sensitive to gastric pH level . | Kombucha is made by fermenting tea (black, green, red, or white) with sugar and other ingredients with specific types of bacteria and fungi. Kombucha contains alcohol, vinegar, B vitamins, caffeine, sugar, and other substances. The cultures used to make kombucha are called SCOBY (Symbiotic Culture of Bacteria and Yeasts). They commonly contain Acetobacter xylinum, Gluconobacter, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. People use kombucha for aging, diabetes, memory, obesity, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Kombucha that is made properly and in clean conditions is possibly safe. Side effects might include stomach upset. Kombucha that is made under conditions where it can be contaminated is possibly unsafe. Kombucha that is made in containers that contain toxic chemicals, such as the lead in pottery glazes, is likely unsafe. These chemicals can get into the kombucha and might cause serious side effects or poisoning. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Kombucha is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth while pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Alcohol use disorder : Kombucha contains alcohol. People with alcohol use disorder should avoid kombucha. Diarrhea : Kombucha contains caffeine. The caffeine in kombucha, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) : Kombucha contains caffeine. The caffeine in kombucha, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea and symptoms of IBS. Surgery : Kombucha seems to affect blood glucose levels. This might interfere with blood glucose control during and after surgery. Stop using kombucha at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery. Weak immune system : Don't use kombucha if you have a weakened immune system. Kombucha can support the growth of bacteria and fungus that can cause serious infections.","Kombucha demonstrated antimicrobial activity against a large number of pathogenic microorganisms at neutral pH and following denaturation, which suggests that it contains antimicrobial compounds other than acetic acid and large proteins (13).

Clinical data suggest modest benefits with oral chamomile in chronic insomnia and for moderate cyclic mastalgia . Chamomile tea had positive effects on glycemic control in patients with diabetes . Several studies have reported that chamomile extracts are effective against mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) . Chamomile may also reduce depressive symptoms in subjects with comorbid GAD plus depression and improve biological markers of stress in people with chronic anxiety . In other controlled trials, application of a chamomile compress was effective and superior to hydrocortisone ointment in facilitating healing of peristomal skin lesions following colostomy , and a chamomile oleogel affected pain relief in patients who had migraine without aura .

Topical chamomile reduced tissue IL-1β and TNF-α in hamsters with oral mucositis (34). In another study, a chamomile extract provided gastroprotection against ethanol-induced ulceration by increasing glutathione levels (25). In an animal model of radiation‐induced intestinal mucositis, apoptotic effects occurred via increased cytosolic cytochrome c and caspase‐3, and depletion of mitochondrial B‐cell lymphoma‐2/Bax ratio (1).

DSI004281,wheat germ,C0982459,"Fermented wheat germ extract (WGE) was developed in the 1990s by Hungarian chemist Mate Hidvegi. It should not be confused with wheat germ oil. WGE has been used as a dietary supplement by cancer patients in Hungary to improve quality of life.In vitro studies suggest WGE may have anticancer , antimetastatic , and immunomodulatory effects. Although it appears to increase estrogen receptor (ER) activity, WGE enhanced efficacy of tamoxifen, an ER antagonist, in ER+ breast cancer cells as well as cisplatin in ovarian cancer cell lines . Animal models suggest WGE may reduce cardiovascular symptoms due to chronic hypertension, diabetes, and obesity , mitigate lupus symptoms , and have antitumor effects comparable to endocrine treatments .Studies in humans are quite limited. A randomized trial of spermidine (extracted from wheat germ) failed to find improvements in memory in older adults with cognitive decline . Other studies suggest benefits of WGE in patients with colorectal cancer , to slow progression of castration-resistant prostate cancer and to reduce treatment-associated febrile neutropenia in pediatric cancer patients . When used along with chemotherapy, WGE may prolong survival of melanoma patients , but larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.Because it potentiates estrogen receptor activity, patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use WGE with caution .",,"Benzoquinone compounds are thought to be active components of WGE (5). In vitro, WGE attenuates cell cycle progression from G2-M to G0-G1 phase, reduces ribonucleotide reductase activity (3) (4), and stimulates immune function via increased NK cell activity and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) expression (16) (17). It also increases TNF and cytokine production by activating metabolic pathways involved in tumor cell death (14). In other experiments, WGE demonstrated cytotoxic effects on human lymphoma cells by inducing apoptosis (4) and against ovarian cancer cells via poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 and PARP-12 expression (5). It also regulated tumor cell proliferation by inhibiting glycolysis and pentose cycle enzymes (19), and induced apoptosis through caspase-3-mediated PARP cleavage (7).Compared to untreated cells, WGE-treated cancer cells had lower levels of VEGF, Cox-2 mRNA, and protein levels, markers of angiogenesis (21). WGE also contributed to impaired glucose utilization resulting in autophagy (22), and induced mobilization and homing of CD34(+) stem cells to the myocardial tissue, which may help stem cell-based regeneration of infarcted myocardium (23).",Triticum aestivum seed,Fermented wheat germ extract | MSC (Code Name),Defatted wheat germ protein,,Wheat germ extract,

Its dark red viscous latex, also known as Sangre de Grado or Dragon’s blood, has been used in traditional medicine for diarrhea and wound healing. In vitro and animal studies suggest it can promote the healing of gastric ulcers and inhibit cutaneous neurogenic inflammation . A mixture of proanthocyanidin oligomers isolated from the latex of C. lechleri has shown benefits for the treatment of travelers’ diarrhea and diarrhea experienced by AIDS patients . Named crofelemer, it has been approved by the FDA as a prescription drug to relieve diarrhea associated with antiretroviral therapy in AIDS patients . Supplementary analysis suggests it may also help reduce abdominal pain in women with irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea . A clinical trial is underway to determine feasibility and tolerability of crofelemer for preventing diarrhea in breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and docetaxel or paclitaxel (THP), or trastuzumab, pertuzumab, docetaxel, and carboplatin (TCHP) . In other studies, crofelemer was reported to be no more effective than placebo in AIDS patients with recurrent genital herpes , while topical use of a cream containing C. lechleri resin and pomegranate seed oil was found useful in preventing and improving skin changes associated with dermal scarring . C. lechleri demonstrated apoptotic effects in cancer cells . However, it also increased the viability of leukemic cells . Further research is needed to determine the anticancer potential.",,"SP-303, a mixture of proanthocyanidin oligomers, inhibited cAMP-mediated chloride secretion in two intestinal epithelial cell lines (6) (7). The dual inhibitory action of crofelemer, a purified proanthocyanidin oligomer, on two structurally unrelated prosecretory intestinal Cl(-) channels may account for the intestinal antisecretory activity (16). The sap of C. lechleri  also decreased capsaicin mediated chloride secretion (8) by inhibiting activation of sensory afferent nerves. In another study, it irreversibly altered the microtubule structure of cancer cells, preventing adhesion and inducing apoptosis (4). It also inhibited mutagenicity of 2-Aminoanthracene, although the mechanism is unknown (10). Topical application of Taspine, an alkaloid derived from C. lechleri sap, to a wound site produced an increase in wound healing activity (11) and an increase in the wound tensile strength 5-7 days following injury (12). Taspine promotes wound healing via increased migration of fibroblasts to the wound site (11) by acting as a chemotactic factor for fibroblasts (12).",Whole plant,Sangre de Drago | Dragon's Blood | Sangre de Grado | Sangre de Dragón | SP-303 | Crofelemer,Croton lechleri,,Croton lechleri,

DSI004542,Rhodiola,C0950013,"Rhodiola is a plant used in traditional medicine in Eastern Europe and Asia to enhance physical and mental performance, stimulate the nervous system, and reduce depressive symptoms. Although Rhodiola rosea extract and its key constituent salidroside have been researched, data in humans are limited. In vitro studies suggest that salidroside may have neuroprotective and anticancer effects . Animal data suggest benefits with rhodiola on cognitive function, but most studies were determined to have a high risk of bias . In humans, preliminary data suggest rhodiola supplementation may improve physical endurance and mental performance , and reduce fatigue and stress . Other small studies suggest it may improve symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder and mild to moderate depression . In one study, it was better tolerated and had fewer side effects than sertraline, although it was also less effective . A systematic review evaluating rhodiola trials determined that higher reporting quality and better methodological quality are needed . In patients with breast cancer receiving epirubicin, a small study suggests that salidroside may have cardioprotective effects , but larger confirmatory studies are needed. | Rhodiola (Rhodiola rosea) is a plant that grows in cold parts of Europe and Asia. The root has a long history of use in traditional medicine. Rhodiola is considered an adaptogen. Adaptogens are a class of natural substances that are believed to stimulate the body's resistance to physical, environmental, and emotional stressors. Rhodiola extract might help protect cells from damage and regulate heartbeat. People use rhodiola for fatigue, anxiety, depression, stress, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Rhodiola is possibly safe when taken for 6-12 weeks. Rhodiola might cause dizziness, dry mouth, or excessive saliva. There isn't enough reliable information to know if rhodiola is safe to use long-term. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if rhodiola is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Autoimmune diseases : Rhodiola might stimulate the immune system. This might worsen autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and others.","In vitro studies suggest that salidroside, a key constituent, confers neuroprotective effects via NO pathway inhibition (9), induces antioxidant enzymes thioredoxin, heme oxygenase-1, and peroxiredoxin-I; downregulates proapoptotic Bax protein; and upregulates antiapoptotic Bcl-XL proteins (8). Rhodiola constituents may also have synergistic antioxidant activity (17) and potential antidepressant effects may be due to inhibition of monoamine oxidases A and B (13). In human breast cancer cells, salidroside induced cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis via mechanisms as yet unidentified, but independent of the estrogen receptor (10).
In animal models, rhodiola exhibits dose- and time-dependent Th1 and Th2 cytokine modulation effects (16).",Root (standardized extract),"Golden root | Rose root | Hong Jing Tian | Rose root extract | Rosenroot | SHR-5 | Arctic Root, Extrait de Rhodiole, Golden Root, Hongjingtian, Hong Jing Tian, King's Crown, Lignum Rhodium, Orpin Rose, Racine d'Or, Racine Dorée, Racine de Rhadiola, Rhodiola rosea, Rhodiole, Rhodiole Rougeâtre, Rodia Riza, Rose Root, Rose Root Extract, Rosenroot, Roseroot, Rosewort, Sedum rhodiola, Sedum rosea, Siberian Golden Root, Siberian Rhodiola Rosea, Snowdown Rose.",Rhodiola,Rhodiola (unspecified) | Rhodiola,Rhodiola,Rhodiola

DSI004598,Schizandra,C1081320,"Schisandra has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine to treat coughs , liver conditions , stomach disorders , sweating , as an adaptogen , and as a tonic to improve vitality. It is also used in various formulas for fatigue and sleep. Its Chinese name, wu wei zi, means five-flavored fruit, to reflect the five flavors recognized in TCM: sour, bitter, sweet, pungent, and salty. In vitro studies suggest that schisandra has anti-inflammatory , anticancer , and cardioprotective effects . Animal studies also suggest cardio- and liver-protective effects . Schisandra appeared to enhance endurance and metabolism , improve cognitive functioning , and exhibit antimicrobial , antioxidant, neuroprotective , and anti-hyperglycemic activities in other preclinical models. Active lignans isolated from schisandra, particularly schisandrin A, appeared to reverse P-glycoprotein-mediated multidrug resistance of various cancer cell lines to doxorubicin, vincristine, and paclitaxel . Studies in humans are limited. Some suggest improvements in patients with fatty liver disease or hepatitis C when schisandra is used in combination with other substances . In liver transplant patients, schisandra appeared to reduce tacrolimus-associated side-effects of diarrhea and agitation and improve liver function . In a small study of renal transplant patients who were CYP3A5 expressers, a schisandra preparation reduced tacrolimus dosing requirements, improved initial dose accuracy, and resulted in fewer dose changes . In small studies of women, schisandra did not induce significant changes in obesity-related measures , but was helpful for menopausal symptoms . A study of a proprietary formulation that included schisandra suggests improved performance of cognitive tasks . In older adults doing regular low-intensity exercise, preliminary data suggest supplementation with a schisandra extract may enhance skeletal muscle strength, but it did not affect muscle mass . Additional research is necessary to determine actual efficacy attributable to schisandra and to uncover possible interactions or side effects associated with this supplement. | Schisandra (Schisandra chinensis) is a plant native to northern China. The fruit is eaten as food and also used to make medicine. Schisandra is considered an adaptogen. Adaptogens are a class of natural substances that are believed to stimulate the body's resistance to physical, environmental, and emotional stressors. The chemicals in schisandra also improve liver function and might increase energy, which can improve endurance and coordination. People use schisandra for menopause, exercise performance, pneumonia, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any use.","When taken by mouth : Schisandra is possibly safe when taken appropriately. It's been used safely for up to 12 weeks. It can cause heartburn, upset stomach, decreased appetite, and itching. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Schisandra is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. It might cause the uterus to contract, which might lead to miscarriage. Do not use schisandra during pregnancy. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if schisandra is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.","Lignans in schisandra have been linked to various effects including hepatoprotective (10), antiproliferative, and estrogenic activities (27). In vitro, schisantherins downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators by blocking NF-κB and MAPK signaling (1). The anthocyanin Cya-3-O-xylrut has been identified as responsible for its antioxidant activity (18).
In animal toxicity models, pretreatment with schisandra lignans provided liver-protective effects via increased DT-diaphorase activity (10), and improved Phase I drug metabolism (28) (29). Schisandra also increased hepatic glutathione levels and glucose-6-phosphate and glutathione reductase activities (17). It lowered blood glucose levels via inhibition of α-glucosidase activity (19), and improved post-ischemic cardiac function by downregulating inflammatory cytokines, activating the eNOS pathway, inhibiting apoptosis, and enhancing cell proliferation (12). In amyloid-beta-induced memory impairment, schisandra increased superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities and glutathione levels in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of mice while decreasing malondialdehyde and oxidized glutathione (14). It also enhanced endurance and metabolism in rat skeletal muscle by upregulating PGC-1α expression (13).
In human renal cell carcinoma cells, a schisandra polysaccharide identified as SCP induced apoptosis via caspase-3 and -9 activation, increased PARP cleavage, and inactivation of the ERK pathway (8). Another polysaccharide known as SCPP11 exhibited antitumor effects in hepatic cancer models via increased thymus index as well as serum IL-2 and TNF-alpha levels, and enhanced phagocytosis and NO production (26). Pgp-mediated chemotherapy drug-resistance in various cancer cell lines was reversed by schisandrins through the inhibition of Pgp and total protein kinase C function/expression (20).
Schisandra coadministration increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus via inhibition of Pgp-mediated efflux and CYP3A-mediated metabolism, and reduction of intestinal first-pass effect (30).",Schisandra chinensis - fruit | Fruit,"Wu wei zi | Schizandra | Five flavor berry | Gomishi | Omicha | Omija | Ngu mie gee | Bac Ngu Vi Tu, Baie de Schisandra, Beiwuweizi, Bei Wu Wei Zi, Chinese Mongolavine, Chinese Schizandra, Chinesischer Limonenbaum, Chosen-Gomischi, Five-Flavor-Fruit, Five-Flavor-Seed, Fructus Schisandrae, Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis, Fruit aux Cinq Saveurs, Gomishi, Hoku-Gomishi, Kadsura chinensis, Kita-Gomishi, Limonnik Kitajskij, Mei Gee, Magnolia Vine, Matsbouza, Nanwuweizi, Ngu Mei Gee, Northern Schisandra, Omicha, Schisandra Berry, Schisandra chinensis, Schisandra chinensis var. rubriflora, Schisandra Sinensis, Schisandra sphaerandra, Schisandra sphenanthera, Schisandrae, Schizandra, Schizandra Chinensis, Schizandre Fructus, Schzandra, Southern Schisandra, Wuhzi, Wuweizi, Wu-Wei-Zi, Western Schisandra, Xiwuweizi.",Schizandra | Schisandra,Schisandra,Schisandra,Schisandra

DSI004616,Hawthorn,C1527346,"Derived from the flower, leaves, and fruits of the plant, hawthorn is also popularly referred to as Shan Zha in Asia. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine to improve digestion, stimulate appetite, treat cardiovascular conditions and hyperlipidemia, and invigorate blood . Hawthorn extract also has a long history in European medicine as a cardiotonic . In vivo and in vitro studies suggest a broad range of pharmacological properties including anti-inflammatory, gastroprotective, antimicrobial, and cardioprotective effects . Clinical studies have shown benefits in patients with congestive heart failure , and larger long-term studies of adjunctive hawthorn also suggest benefits . In addition, a systematic review concluded that adjunctive hawthorn improved physiological outcomes and symptom control in CHF patients . However two smaller trials did not find benefit , one of which suggested an increased early risk of disease progression . Studies that evaluate the hypotensive effects of hawthorn are mixed . Although data suggest a lack of notable interactions, definitive safety data are needed . Hawthorn also should not be used in place of conventional heart failure therapies and its use should be monitored by the treating physician . | Hawthorn is a flowering shrub in the rose family. Common species include Crataegus monogyna, Crataegus laevigata, and Crataegus oxyacantha. The hawthorn leaves, berries, and flowers are used as medicine. They contain chemicals called flavonoids, which have antioxidant effects. Hawthorn also seems to improve blood circulation and affect blood flow from the heart. People most commonly use hawthorn for chest pain, heart failure, blood circulation problems, high blood pressure, anxiety, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Hawthorn is possibly safe when used in doses up to 1800 mg daily for up to 16 weeks. There isn't enough reliable information to know if hawthorn is safe when used for longer than 16 weeks. Hawthorn is usually well-tolerated. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if hawthorn is safe or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if hawthorn is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Heart disease : Hawthorn can interact with many prescription drugs used to treat heart disease. If you have a heart condition, don't use hawthorn without talking to your healthcare provider. Surgery : Hawthorn might slow blood clotting and increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using hawthorn at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Pharmacologic activities of hawthorn flower, leaf, and berry extracts are attributed to constituents such as flavonoids and oligomeric procyanidins (17) (22). Laboratory experiments suggest cardiac action of the flavonoids occurs via inhibition of the 3’,5’-cyclic adenosine monophosphate phosphodiesterase, and demonstrate positive inotropic effects by hawthorn that increase heart rate (4). Inotropic and vasodilatory effects have also been related to increased myocardial perfusion and reduced afterload (30).

It is also used for headache, both low and high blood pressure, preventing Parkinson disease, depression, dementia, stroke, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. Don't confuse black tea with other caffeine sources, including coffee, oolong tea, and green tea. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : Black tea is commonly consumed as a beverage. Drinking black tea in moderate amounts (about 4 cups daily) is likely safe for most people. Drinking more than 4 cups of black tea daily is possibly unsafe. Drinking large amounts might cause side effects due to the caffeine content. These side effects can range from mild to serious and include headache and irregular heartbeat. Drinking very high amounts of black tea containing more than 10 grams of caffeine is likely unsafe. Doses of black tea this high might cause death or other severe side effects. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Drinking moderate amounts of black tea during pregnancy is possibly safe. Do not drink more than 3 cups of black tea daily. This provides about 300 mg of caffeine. Consuming more than this during pregnancy is possibly unsafe and has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage, increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and other negative effects, including symptoms of caffeine withdrawal in newborns and lower birth weight. Breast-feeding : Drinking moderate amounts of black tea while breast-feeding is possibly safe. But drinking more than 3 cups of black tea daily is possibly unsafe. The caffeine in black tea is passed into breastmilk. It might cause irritability and increased bowel movements in nursing infants. Children : Black tea is possibly safe in children when consumed in amounts found in food and beverages. Anxiety disorders : The caffeine in black tea might make anxiety worse. Bleeding disorders : There is some concern that the caffeine in black tea might slow blood clotting. Use caffeine cautiously if you have a bleeding disorder. Heart problems : Black tea contains caffeine. Large amounts of caffeine can cause irregular heartbeat in certain people. If you have a heart condition, use caffeine in moderation. Diabetes : The caffeine in black tea might affect blood sugar. Use black tea with caution if you have diabetes. Diarrhea : Black tea contains caffeine. The caffeine in black tea, especially when taken in large amounts, might worsen diarrhea. Seizures : Black tea contains caffeine. High doses of caffeine might cause seizures or decrease the effects of drugs used to prevent seizures. If you have ever had a seizure, don't take high doses of caffeine. Glaucoma : Drinking caffeinated black tea increases the pressure inside the eye. The increase occurs within 30 minutes and lasts for at least 90 minutes. If you have glaucoma, use caffeine with caution. Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Black tea might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use black tea. High blood pressure : The caffeine in black tea might increase blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. But this doesn't seem to occur in people who drink black tea or other caffeinated products regularly. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) : Black tea contains caffeine. The caffeine in black tea, especially when taken in large amounts, might worsen diarrhea and might worsen symptoms of IBS. Brittle bones (osteoporosis) : Drinking black tea can increase the amount of calcium that is flushed out in the urine. This might weaken bones. If you have osteoporosis, don't drink more than 3 cups of black tea daily. If you are generally healthy and get enough calcium from your food or supplements, drinking about 4 cups of black tea daily doesn't seem to increase the risk of getting osteoporosis.",,Camellia sinensis - leaf,"Black Leaf Tea, Camellia sinensis, Camellia thea, Camellia theifera, Chinese Tea, English Tea, Feuille de Thé Noir, Té Negro, Tea, Thé Anglais, Thé Noir, Thea bohea, Thea sinensis, Thea viridis, Theaflavin, Théaflavine.",Black tea,Black Tea,,Black Tea

DSI004635,Green tea,C1384640,"Green tea is a beverage derived from the unfermented leaves of a plant native to Asia. Green tea extract is marketed as an antioxidant and dietary supplement to support cardiovascular, metabolic, cognitive, and cellular health. Active constituents include the polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), caffeine, and theanine. Green tea consumption may reduce risk for dementia , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , and all-cause but not cancer-related mortality . Data are mixed on whether it can reduce risk of gastric and esophageal cancers . Other findings suggest preventive benefits with green tea and its active compounds against oral premalignant lesions and for those at high risk of developing liver or colorectal cancers but not colorectal adenomas . There is no association between green tea and risk for malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma , but intake may reduce risk for myelodysplastic syndrome and kidney cancer . In prostate cancer patients, a blend of green tea, pomegranate, broccoli, and curcumin had a protective effect following post-radical treatment . Green tea consumption also decreased PSA levels in patients prior to prostatectomy . However, combination supplementation with the highest nontoxic doses of green tea catechins, selenium, and lycopene was associated with an elevated incidence of prostate cancer in high-risk patients , and long-term intake of an EGCG product did not reduce prostate cancer risk . Other limited data suggest oral EGCG may induce a biologic response in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or reduce radiation-induced esophagitis in lung cancer patients , but did not prevent recurrence in advanced ovarian cancer . Topical EGCG may help relieve radiation-induced dermatitis in breast cancer patients , but these results are also preliminary. Regular green tea consumption may actually increase breast cancer risk in some postmenopausal women . Future studies are needed to resolve this ambiguity and to determine whether there are potential benefits on overall cancer risk . Additional studies suggest positive effects of green tea on blood pressure and glycemic control in type-2 diabetes patients , and on weight reduction in women with polycystic ovary syndrome . Moderate green tea consumption was not associated with increased risk of kidney stone formation , but the caffeinated form may cause insomnia and nausea. Animal models suggest use of green tea extract during fasting may increase toxicity risk . Clinical data show that EGCG 200 mg twice daily for one year is safe , whereas 800 mg daily was associated with elevated liver enzymes . | Green tea is made from the Camellia sinensis plant. Its dried leaves and leaf buds are used to make several different teas, including black and oolong teas. Green tea is prepared by steaming and pan-frying the Camellia sinensis leaves and then drying them. Green tea is not fermented, so it's able to maintain important molecules called polyphenols, which seem to be responsible for many of its benefits. It also contains caffeine. People commonly use a US FDA-approved prescription product containing green tea for genital warts. As a drink or supplement, green tea is sometimes used for high cholesterol, high blood pressure, to prevent heart disease, and to prevent ovarian cancer. It is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Green tea is commonly consumed as a beverage. Drinking green tea in moderate amounts (about 8 cups daily) is likely safe for most people. Green tea extract is possibly safe when taken for up to 2 years or when used as a mouthwash, short-term. Drinking more than 8 cups of green tea daily is possibly unsafe. Drinking large amounts might cause side effects due to the caffeine content. These side effects can range from mild to serious and include headache and irregular heartbeat. Green tea extract also contains a chemical that has been linked with liver injury when used in high doses. When applied to the skin : Green tea extract is likely safe when an FDA-approved ointment is used, short-term. Other green tea products are possibly safe when used appropriately. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Drinking green tea is possibly safe in amounts of 6 cups per day or less. This amount of green tea provides about 300 mg of caffeine. Drinking more than this amount during pregnancy is possibly unsafe and has been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage and other negative effects. Also, green tea might increase the risk of birth defects associated with folic acid deficiency. Breast-feeding : Caffeine passes into breast milk and can affect a nursing infant. Closely monitor caffeine intake to make sure it is on the low side (2-3 cups per day) while breast-feeding. High intake of caffeine while breast-feeding can cause sleep problems, irritability, and increased bowel activity in breast-fed infants. Children : Green tea is possibly safe for children when taken by mouth in amounts commonly found in foods and beverages, or when gargled three times daily for up to 90 days. There isn't enough reliable information to know if green tea extract is safe when taken by mouth in children. There's some concern that it might cause liver damage. Anemia : Drinking green tea may make anemia worse. Anxiety disorders : The caffeine in green tea might make anxiety worse. Bleeding disorders : The caffeine in green tea might increase the risk of bleeding. Don't drink green tea if you have a bleeding disorder. Heart conditions : When taken in large amounts, the caffeine in green tea might cause irregular heartbeat. Diabetes : The caffeine in green tea might affect blood sugar control. If you drink green tea and have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar carefully. Diarrhea : The caffeine in green tea, especially when taken in large amounts, can worsen diarrhea. Seizures : Green tea contains caffeine. High doses of caffeine might cause seizures or decrease the effects of drugs used to prevent seizures. If you have ever had a seizure, don't use high doses of caffeine or caffeine-containing products such as green tea. Glaucoma : Drinking green tea increases pressure inside the eye. The increase occurs within 30 minutes and lasts for at least 90 minutes. High blood pressure : The caffeine in green tea might increase blood pressure in people with high blood pressure. But this effect might be less in people who consume caffeine from green tea or other sources regularly. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) : Green tea contains caffeine. The caffeine in green tea, especially when taken in large amounts, might worsen diarrhea in some people with IBS. Liver disease : Green tea extract supplements have been linked to rare cases of liver damage. Green tea extracts might make liver disease worse. Talk to your doctor before taking green tea extract. Drinking green tea in normal amounts is still probably safe. Weak bones (osteoporosis) : Drinking green tea can increase the amount of calcium that is flushed out in the urine. This might weaken bones. If you have osteoporosis, don't drink more than 6 cups of green tea daily. If you are generally healthy and get enough calcium from your food or supplements, drinking about 8 cups of green tea daily doesn't seem to increase the risk of getting osteoporosis.","Green tea may confer cardiovascular protection by increasing HDL and lowering LDL and triglyceride levels (28). Blood pressure modulation may be mediated by EGCG which induces NO production that results in vasodilation (29). Neurocognitive benefits with green tea extract may occur from enhanced brain connectivity during working memory processing (30), and EGCG may inhibit tau protein aggregation to reduce toxicity in neuronal model cells (31).
Chemopreventive properties are attributed to polyphenols, particularly EGCG which may inhibit enzymes involved in cell replication and DNA synthesis (32). In vitro data suggest concentrations of 30 mcg/mL of EGCG and EGC inhibit arachidonic acid metabolism by 30–75%, which may reduce colon cancer risk (33). Other studies in human colon cancer cell lines suggest EGCG inhibits topoisomerase I but not II (34). It also inhibited DNA replication in leukemia cancer cell lines (35), and modulated VEGF leading to apoptosis in leukemic cells (36). An early animal study identified caffeine in green tea as an important component for inhibition of UVB light-induced carcinogenesis (37).",Leaf,"Chinese tea | Green tea extract | Green tea polyphenols | Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) | Benifuuki, Camellia sinensis, Camellia thea, Camellia theifera, Constituant Polyphénolique de Thé Vert, CPTV, EGCG, Epigallo Catechin Gallate, Épigallo-Catéchine Gallate, Epigallocatechin Gallate, Extrait de Camellia Sinensis, Extrait de Thé, Extrait de Thé Vert, Extrait de Thea Sinensis, Green Sencha Tea, Green Tea Extract, Green Tea Polyphenolic Fraction, GTP, GTPF, Japanese Sencha Green Tea, Japanese Tea, Kunecatechins, Matcha Green Tea, Poly E, Polyphenon E, PTV, Té Verde, Tea, Tea Extract, Tea Green, Thé, Thé de Camillia, Thé Japonais, Thé Vert, Thé Vert de Yame, Thé Vert Sensha, Thea bohea, Thea sinensis, Thea viridis, Yame Green Tea, Yabukita, Yame Tea.",Green tea,Green Tea,Green Tea,Green Tea

Vitis vinifera and Vitis labrusca are two common grapevine species. Vitis labrusca is commonly known as Concord grape. The whole fruit, skin, leaves, and seed of grape are used as medicine. Grape contains flavonoids, which can have antioxidant effects. They might help prevent heart disease and have other beneficial effects. Red grape varieties provide more antioxidants than white or blush grape varieties. People use grape for poor circulation that can cause the legs to swell. It is also used for eye stress, heart disease, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, obesity, and many other conditions. But there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. Don't confuse grape with grapefruit. These are not the same. | Oregon grape is a plant. The bark, root, and root-like stem (rhizome) are used to make medicine. Oregon grape is used for scaly, itchy skin (psoriasis), eczema (atopic dermatitis), stomach problems, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Grapes are commonly consumed in foods. It is possibly safe when the whole fruit or the extract of the fruit, leaf, or seed, are used as medicine. Grape seed extracts and fruit extracts have been used safely for up to 11 months. Eating large quantities of grapes might cause diarrhea. Some people have allergic reactions to grapes and grape products. Some other side effects might include cough, dry mouth, and headache. When applied to the skin : Grape seed oil is possibly safe when used for up to 3 weeks. There isn't enough reliable information to know if other parts of grape are safe to use. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Grapes are commonly consumed in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if grape is safe to use in medicinal amounts when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts. Children : Grapes are commonly consumed in foods. But keep in mind that whole grapes are a potential choking hazard for children aged 5 years and younger. Whole grapes should be cut in half or quartered before being served to children. There isn't enough reliable information to know if grape is safe to use in amounts greater than those found in foods. Bleeding conditions : Grape extract might slow blood clotting. Taking grape extract might increase the chances of bruising and bleeding in people with bleeding conditions. But it's not clear if this is a big concern. Surgery : Grape extract might slow blood clotting. It might cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using grape extract at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery. | When taken by mouth : Oregon grape is LIKELY SAFE when taken in the amounts found in foods. There isn't enough reliable information to know if Oregon grape is safe to use in medicinal amounts or what the side effects might be. When applied to the skin : Oregon grape cream is POSSIBLY SAFE for most people when applied directly to the skin. It can cause some side effects such as itching, burning, irritation, and allergic reactions. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : It's LIKELY UNSAFE to use Oregon grape if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. One of the chemicals in Oregon grape, berberine, may cross the placenta and might cause harm to the fetus. It can also be transferred to the infant through breast milk. Brain damage (kernicterus) has been reported in newborn infants exposed to berberine. Children : It's LIKELY UNSAFE to give Oregon grape to infants.

DSI004652,Maca,C0872905,"Maca is a nutritionally valuable plant native to Peru that grows in harsh climates above 4,000 feet. It has been used traditionally to enhance fertility and sexual performance in both men and women and to relieve menopausal symptoms . In vitro, maca or its constituents have demonstrated antiviral , antioxidant , anti-inflammatory, analgesic, or neuroprotective activities. Animal studies suggest maca may increase endurance , enhance sexual function , and improve memory deficits . It also demonstrated antidepressant and postmenopausal hormone-modulating effects. Only a few small trials have been conducted in humans. Maca consumption was associated with lower serum IL-6 levels and higher health status . In men, preliminary findings suggest supplementation may enhance subjective sexual well-being , but data are mixed on whether it can affect various parameters of semen quality or sperm concentration . A systematic review determined high dose supplementation to improve antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction . In women, several studies suggest maca improves both antidepressant- and menopause-induced sexual dysfunction although one small study showed neither hormonal nor immunological effects . In addition, systematic reviews have deemed evidence for improving sexual dysfunction or menopausal symptoms to be limited. Another review found maca is not an effective anti-aging agent . A case report showed maca may interfere with testosterone immunoassays . Although it is unclear the extent to which maca may affect blood hormone levels, patients should discuss any use of this supplement with their physician. | Maca, also called Ginseng Andin, Peruvian Ginseng, Lepidium meyenii, or Lepidium peruvianum, is a relative of radish and smells similar to butterscotch. Maca is a plant that grows on the high plateaus of the Andes Mountains. It's been cultivated as a root vegetable for at least 3000 years. The root is also used to make medicine, but there isn't enough reliable information available to know how maca might work. People take maca by mouth for male infertility, health problems after menopause, increasing sexual desire in healthy people, and other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Maca is likely safe for most people when eaten in foods. Maca is possibly safe when taken in larger amounts as medicine, short-term. Doses up to 3 grams daily seem to be safe when taken for up to 4 months. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if maca is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts. Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Extracts from maca might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by estrogen, do not use these extracts.","Maca contains glucosinolates, mostly benzylglucosinolate, along with hydroxy or methoxylated benzyl derivatives and tryptophan-derived compounds, and depending on the phenotype (red, yellow, purple or black) may be associated with different biological effects (31).
In vitro, both methanolic and aqueous extracts of maca exhibit estrogenic activity (10). A methanol maca extract demonstrated antiviral activity against Flu-A and Flu-B viruses (17). An isolated N‑alkylamide from maca root exerted cannabimimetic actions (32). Maca polysaccharides demonstrated radical scavenging activity (18). Macamides, normally not present in fresh plants but introduced during traditional drying practices (31), are fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitors that modulate release of neurotransmitters (19). Antidepressant-like effects were associated with activation of both noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems and attenuation of oxidative stress (20).
In animal models, maca powder enhanced serum luteinizing hormone (LH) levels in female rats during the proestrus LH surge in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting it may enhance fertility (33). In postmenopausal models, maca modulates hormone levels particularly by decreasing follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels (21).
In humans, although maca does not affect serum levels of LH, FSH, prolactin, testosterone, or estradiol in men (4) (9), it appears to modulate some hormone levels in women in some studies (24) (26) but not others (25) (27). Increased LH and decreased FSH that corresponded with improved sexual functioning in postmenopausal women are potentially attributed to a negative feedback loop, resulting in increased androgen production (24) (26). It may also exert androgenic effects at the testosterone receptor on target organs without affecting testosterone or gonadotrophin levels (24) (30). At the same time, the benefits of maca for antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction in women may be more a function of advancing age rather than menopausal status, as there was no correlation with estrogen levels (24).",Lepidium meyenii - Root,"Maca-maca | Maino | Ayak chichira | Ayak willku | Ayak Chichira, Ayuk Willku, Ginseng Andin, Ginseng Péruvien, Lepidium meyenii, Lepidium peruvianum, Maca Maca, Maca Péruvien, Maino, Maka, Peruvian Ginseng, Peruvian Maca.",Maca,Maca,Maca,Maca

It is also used as a general tonic to improve energy levels, health, and longevity , and topically as an analgesic . Active constituents include alkaloids, steroidal lactones, saponins, and withanolides. Ashwagandha has neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties which may protect against cartilage damage in osteoarthritis . It also improved hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and insulin sensitivity in a murine model of type 2 diabetes . Other studies indicate cytotoxic, immunomodulating , chemopreventive and radiosensitizing effects , and enhancement in chromosomal stability . Small studies suggest ashwagandha may promote growth, hemoglobin level, and red blood cell count in children , improve sexual health , male infertility , and relieve mild to moderate climacteric symptoms in perimenopausal women . Findings also indicate that it relieves anxiety and stress , with a systematic review/dose-response meta-analysis citing the need for high-quality evidence . Additional studies showed improvements in both non-restorative sleep in healthy adults and sleep quality in patients with insomnia . In patients with schizophrenia, adjunctive use improved symptoms and stress , and affected markers of metabolic syndrome . Preliminary data suggest improvements in measures of cognitive function in patients with bipolar disorder and balance in patients with progressive degenerative cerebral ataxias . Ashwagandha formulations were also shown to benefit patients with osteoarthritis and produced analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and chondro-protective effects in those with knee joint pain . Ashwagandha also showed anticancer effects against several cancer cell lines , but was ineffective against drug-resistant cancer stem cells . It prevented chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in a murine model , and the compound Withaferin A enhanced oxaliplatin effects in human pancreatic cancer cells . In a small trial of breast cancer patients, ashwagandha alleviated chemotherapy-induced fatigue and improved quality of life . Confirmatory research is needed. Ashwagandha may increase testosterone levels and therefore, patients with hormone-sensitive prostate cancer should consult their physicians before taking it . | Ashwagandha is an evergreen shrub that grows in Asia and Africa. It is commonly used for stress. There is little evidence for its use as an ""adaptogen."" Ashwagandha contains chemicals that might help calm the brain, reduce swelling, lower blood pressure, and alter the immune system. Since ashwagandha is traditionally used as an adaptogen, it is used for many conditions related to stress. Adaptogens are believed to help the body resist physical and mental stress. Some of the conditions it is used for include insomnia, aging, anxiety and many others, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using ashwagandha for COVID-19. Don't confuse ashwagandha with Physalis alkekengi. Both are known as winter cherry. Also, don't confuse ashwagandha with American ginseng, Panax ginseng, or eleuthero.","When taken by mouth : Ashwagandha is possibly safe when used for up to 3 months. The long-term safety of ashwagandha is not known. Large doses of ashwagandha might cause stomach upset, diarrhea, and vomiting. Rarely, liver problems, including severe liver failure and a need for liver transplantation, might occur. When applied to the skin : Lotion containing ashwagandha is possibly safe when used for up to 2 months. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : It is likely unsafe to use ashwagandha when pregnant. There is some evidence that ashwagandha might cause miscarriages. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if ashwagandha is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. ""Auto-immune diseases"" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions : Ashwagandha might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using ashwagandha. Surgery : Ashwagandha may slow down the central nervous system. Healthcare  providers worry that anesthesia and other medications during and after surgery might increase this effect. Stop taking ashwagandha at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery. Thyroid disorders : Ashwagandha might increase thyroid hormone levels. Ashwagandha should be used cautiously or avoided if you have a thyroid condition or take thyroid hormone medications.","Alkaloids, steroidal lactones, saponins, and withanolides are considered the biologically active components of ashwagandha. Anti-arthritic effects are attributed to cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition.
In animal studies, anti-inflammatory activity by ashwagandha was comparable to hydrocortisone (15). Brain antioxidant effects and CNS tranquilizing effects may be due to influences on GABA receptor function (2) (17). Withanolides in the roots and leaves are considered similar to steroids in their biological activities (41). Triethylene glycol, a compound isolated from the leaves, was identified as an active sleep-inducing component in a murine model, and may potentially be used to relieve insomnia (42).
Microarray analysis revealed that ashwagandha represses proinflammatory gene expression, including IL-6, IL-1β, IL-8, Hsp70, and STAT-2, and induces p38/MAPK expression in a prostate cancer cell line (16). Ashwagandha may inhibit tumor growth (1) (21) and increased cytotoxic T lymphocyte production (8). In vitro studies show that root extracts have cytotoxic properties against lung, colon, CNS, and breast cancer cell lines (6). Withaferin A induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and disruption of mitochondrial function in a human leukemia cell line, thereby inducing apoptosis (18). In estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and negative (ER-) breast cancer cells, withaferin A induced apoptosis and decreased tumor size (19). Apoptosis of cancer cells by withanone is mediated through p53 (7). Withianone also exerts anticancer activity by binding to the TPX2-Aurora A Complex (29). Other studies show ashwagandha cytotoxicity is related to its structure. It enhances ATPase and inhibits succinate dehydrogenase activities, impairing oxidative phosphorylation.
In animal studies, ashwagandha enhanced radiation therapy effects (20) by reducing tumor GSH levels (10), and reversed paclitaxel-induced neutropenia in mice (12).

The compound mevinolin decreased cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting HMG CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis (3). Suggested hypoglycemic mechanisms include increased glucokinase activity and insulin secretion, which increases glucose utilization by peripheral tissues, inhibits glycogen synthase kinase, and promotes glycogen synthesis (19).
A lectin isolated from the fruiting bodies of oyster mushroom demonstrated antitumor activity in mice bearing sarcoma and hepatoma (1). Another study found development of precancerous aberrant crypt foci significantly reduced in mice fed a diet containing 10% pleuran, an isolated beta-glucan (4). RNase Po1, a guanylic acid-specific ribonuclease from oyster mushroom induced apoptosis in tumor cells (18).

In vitro, antidiabetic effects are attributed to terpenoids that inhibit alpha-glucosidase (15). Anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties may occur via inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) (3). Immunomodulating effects are attributed to Th1/Th2 cytokine secretion in immune cells and regulation of antigen-specific antibody production (16). Anti-quorum sensing activity in chaga conks suggests broader anti-infection attributes beyond immunomodulatory effects (12).
In animal studies, a methanolic extract of chaga produced beneficial effects on learning and memory via decreased malondialdehyde and nitrite levels, decreased acetylcholinesterase activity, and restored glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and acetylcholine levels (18). Antifatigue effects were attributed to polysaccharides from chaga, which increased endurance and glycogen content of liver and muscle in mice, while decreasing blood lactic acid and serum urea nitrogen levels (20). Anti-inflammatory effects in animal colitis models were related to suppression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, iNOS, and interleukin (IL)-1beta (19).
3beta-hydroxy-lanosta-8, 24-dien-21-al, and inotodiol constituents in chaga produce antimutagenic and antioxidative activities (9). Water-soluble lignin derivatives have also been identified as bioactive constituents with anticancer properties (26). A hot-water extract of chaga exhibited inhibitory and proapoptotic actions against colon cancer cells via upregulation of Bax and caspase-3 and downregulation of Bcl-2 (5). Inhibition of colorectal cancer was exerted by the constituent ergosterol via downregulation of the beta-catenin pathway (21). Inotodiol, a triterpenoid isolated from chaga, inhibited proliferation of cervical cancer cells and induced apoptosis in vitro via increased Bax expression, decreased Bcl-2, cyclin E downregulation, and p27 up-regulation (23). Aqueous extracts of chaga inhibited growth of human hepatoma cells via G0/G1 phase cell-cycle arrest and selective apoptotic induction (1). Other apoptotic characteristics can induce caspase cleavage and nuclear fragmentation (7). | Beta glucans, polysaccharides present in reishi, demonstrated antitumor and immunostimulating activities (18) (40). Its triterpene compounds may inhibit tumor invasion by reducing matrix metalloproteinase expression (16), and tumor metastases by limiting attachment to endothelial cells (17). Findings also indicate that reishi induces natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity against various cancer cell lines via activation of the natural cytotoxic receptors (NKG2D/NCR) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling pathways, which result in exocytosis of perforin and granulysin (31). Reishi polysaccharides were shown to increase expression of the major histocompatibility (MHC) class I and costimulatory molecules on melanoma cells, resulting in enhanced antitumor cytotoxicity (32). In ovarian cancer cells, reishi induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, activated caspase 3 to induce apotosis, increased p53, and inhibited Akt expression (27).","Although chaga is an edible fungus, it is not commonly ingested due to its bitter nature. Instead, tea made from the whole mushroom is consumed.","Cinder conk | Birch conk | Clinker polypore | Ling zhi | Lin zi | Mushroom of immortality | Agaric, Agaricus, Agaricus blazei, Agarikusutake, Brazil Mushroom, Brazilian Mushroom, Brazilian Sun-Mushroom, Callampa Agaricus, Champignon Agaric, Champignon Brésilien, Champignon du Brésil, Cogumelo do Sol, Kawariharatake, Himematsutake, Mushroom, Sun Mushroom. | Black Hoof Fungus, Meshima, Mesima, Meshimakobu, Phellinus linteus, Sanghuang, Sanghwang, Song Gen. | Aga, Agaric, Amanita muscaria, Amanite Tue-Mouches, Fausse Oronge, Fly Agaric, Matamoscas, Red Fly Agaric, Red Toadstool, Soma. | Bearded Tooth, Crinière de Lion, Hedgehog Fungus, Hydne Hérisson, Lion's Mane, Monkey Head, Monkey's Head, Pom Pom, Pompom, Satyr's Beard, Tree Hedgehog, Yamabushitake. | Champignon Dansant, Champignon des Fous Dansants, Champignon Maitake, Dancing Mushroom, Grifola, Grifola frondosa, Hen of the Woods, Hongo Maitake, King of Mushrooms, Maitake, Monkey's Bench, Mushroom, Ram's Head, Roi des Champignons, Sheep's Head, Shelf Fungi. | Bai Fu Ling, Bokryung, Champignon Poria, China-root, Daedalea Extensa, Fu Ling, FuShen, Hoelen, Hongos Poria, Indian Bread, Macrohyporia Cocos, Macrohyporia Extensa, Matsuhodo, Mushroom, Pachyma Cocos, Polyporus, Poria, Poria cocos, Poria Cocos Sclerotium, Poria Sclerotium, Sclerotium Cocus, Sclerotium of Tuckahoe, Sclerotium Poria Cocao, Sclerotium Poriae Cocos, Tuckahoe, Wolfiporia cocos, Wolfiporia Extensa. | Basidiomycetes Mushroom, Champignon Basidiomycète, Champignon d'Immortalité, Champignon Reishi, Champignons Reishi, Ganoderma, Ganoderma lucidum, Hongo Reishi, Ling Chih, Ling Zhi, Lingzhi, Mannentake, Mushroom, Mushroom of Immortality, Mushroom of Spiritual Potency, Red Reishi, Reishi, Reishi Antler Mushroom, Reishi Rouge, Rei-Shi, Spirit Plant. | Bolet à Couleurs Variées, Bolet Versicolore, Boletus versicolor, Champignon Coriolus, Champignon de Queue de Dinde, Cloud Mushroom, Coriolus, Coriolus Mushroom, Coriolus versicolor, Hongo Coriolus, Kawaratake, Krestin, Polypore à Couleurs Variées, Polypore Versicolor, Polyporus Versicolor, Polysaccharide-K, Polysaccharide Krestin, Polysaccharide Peptide, Polysaccharopeptide, Polystictus versicolor, PSK, PSP, Trametes versicolor, Turkey Tail, Yun Chi, Yun Zhi, Yun-Zhi, Yunzhi.",,Agarikon Mushroom | Coriolus Mushroom | Mushroom protein | Mushrooms | Maitake Mushroom | Mushroom (various) | Mushroom (unspecified) | Oyster Mushroom | Poria Mushrooms | Poris Mushroom | Poria Mushroom,Chaga Mushroom | Reishi Mushroom,Agaricus Mushroom | Black Hoof Mushroom | Fly Agaric Mushroom | Lion's Mane Mushroom | Maitake Mushroom | Poria Mushroom | Reishi Mushroom | Turkey Tail Mushroom

DSI004744,Amygdalin,C0002707,"Amygdalin is a naturally occurring cyanogenic glycoside derived from nuts, plants, and the pits of certain fruits, primarily apricots. Bitter almonds containing amygdalin are used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to remove “blood stasis” and to treat abscesses . Amygdalin was first used to treat cancer more than a century ago in Russia and later in the United States. A purified form sold as Laetrile has been a popular alternative cancer therapy since the 1960s. Some claimed amygdalin to be a vitamin (B17) and that deficiencies could cause cancer, but this is not substantiated by scientific evidence . Amygdalin is banned in the United States, but it is available in other countries and online. Amygdalin is metabolized by the enzyme beta-glucosidase into benzaldehyde, glucose and cyanide in the intestine . Cyanide is believed to be cytotoxic with actions selective against cancerous cells, but results from animal studies were mostly negative . Other preclinical data suggest that amygdalin has hepatoprotective effects ; may help relieve pain due to anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties ; and exerts protective effects in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Amygdalin also inhibited tumor growth, but further studies are needed to confirm this finding . A clinical trial in the late 1970s supported by the National Cancer Institute did not find amygdalin beneficial, and some patients in the study developed cyanide toxicity . A systematic review also concluded that amygdalin is ineffective against cancer . With the recent discovery of anticancer properties of amygdalin through previously unknown mechanisms , there is renewed interest in whether this agent may have potential as an anticancer treatment. However, amygdalin is not approved for use in the United States.",,"Amygdalin is metabolized by the enzyme beta-glucosidase, which removes the glucose molecules to form prunasin and mandelonitrile. This is further broken down to benzaldehyde and hydrocyanic acid (3) (4). When consumed orally, amygdalin is more likely to produce cyanide toxicity, compared with the injectable form (17), possibly due to the presence of enzymes from the microflora in the intestine (18). Cyanide from the hydrolysis of amygdalin is cytotoxic. It was postulated that this action is selective against cancerous cells because normal cells convert the cyanide to benign thiocyanate via rhodanese (19) (20) (21). This theory has not been proven in humans (22).
Amygdalin demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by promoting immunomodulation of Treg cells (24). In animal studies, amygdalin suppressed prostaglandin E(2) synthesis and NO production through COX-2 and iNOS inhibition (7). It also reduced inflammation pain by inhibiting TNF-alpha and IL-1beta (8), and exerts neurotrophic effects by activating the extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 pathway (25).
Recent studies found amygdalin may have anticancer effects. In animal models, amygdalin inhibits the tumor-promoting effect of the Epstein-Barr virus (12). In human prostate cancer cells, it increased pro-apoptotic Bax protein expression and caspase-3 enzyme activity, while decreasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression (23). It also downregulates cell cycle-related genes in human colon cancer cells (13). Amygdalin may inhibit growth and proliferation in bladder cancer cell lines by decreasing cell cycle regulatory proteins cdk2 and cyclin A (16). It also induces growth-regulating protein follistatin expression in human hepatocarcinoma cells (15).",,Apricot pits | Vitamin B17 | Mandelonitrile-beta-glucuronide (semi-synthetic) | Mandelonitrile beta-D-gentiobioside (natural product) | Laevorotatory and mandelonitrile | Prunasin,,Amygdalin,Amygdalin,

DSI004758,Arsenic,C0003818,"Arsenic is a trace element that naturally occurs in foods, such as rice. Organic arsenic is usually safe, but another form, inorganic arsenic, can be toxic. The role of arsenic in the body isn't well understood. Most adults probably eat about 12-50 mcg of arsenic every day from a usual diet. Some experts have suggested that an average adult should have 12-25 mcg daily. People use homeopathic preparations of arsenic for arsenic poisoning, COVID-19, seizures, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Homeopathic preparations are often so dilute that they contain little or no arsenic. Inorganic arsenic compounds, which are different than organic arsenic, are considered poisonous. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) classifies inorganic arsenic as a known cancer-causing agent. The maximum amount of arsenic allowed in drinking water is 10 mcg per liter.","When taken by mouth : Organic arsenic is likely safe when eaten in normal food amounts. But inorganic arsenic, a different form of arsenic, is likely unsafe, especially when used long-term or in high doses. Taking 10 mcg/kg daily over time can cause arsenic poisoning. Higher doses can cause severe poisoning and death. Inorganic arsenic is classified as a cancer-causing agent in humans. Drinking water containing large amounts of inorganic arsenic has been linked to cancer, heart problems, and diabetes. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Organic arsenic is likely safe when eaten in normal food amounts. But inorganic arsenic, a different form of arsenic, is likely unsafe when taken by mouth while pregnant or breast-feeding. Inorganic arsenic has been linked to miscarriages, stillbirths, and, in some cases, death of the newborn infant. Do not take arsenic supplements if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Children : Organic arsenic is likely safe when eaten by children in normal food amounts. But inorganic arsenic, a different form of arsenic, is likely unsafe when taken by mouth. Over time, drinking water containing large amounts of inorganic arsenic may lead to high blood pressure and problems with memory, attention, and intelligence in children. Low levels of folic acid (folic acid deficiency) : Folic acid deficiency changes the way the body processes arsenic. Having low levels of folic acid may increase arsenic levels in the body.

Alpha-linolenic acid is most commonly used for diseases of the heart and blood vessels, such as hardening of the arteries, heart disease, and high blood pressure. It is also used for other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. You have probably heard a lot about other omega-3 fatty acids such as EPA and DHA, which are found in fish oil. Alpha-linolenic acid may not have the same benefits as EPA or DHA. Be careful not to confuse alpha-linolenic acid with these other omega-3 fatty acids.","When taken by mouth : Alpha-linolenic acid is likely safe for most adults when used in amounts found in foods. But keep in mind, it is high in calories and may cause weight gain if consumed in excess. There isn't enough reliable information to know if it is safe to use as a medicine. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Alpha-linolenic acid is likely safe in amounts found in food. But not enough is known about the safety of alpha-linolenic acid during pregnancy and breast-feeding when used in higher amounts than those typically found in foods. Stay on the safe side and avoid alpha-linolenic acid supplements. Kidney transplant : Consuming large amounts of alpha-linolenic acid might increase the risk for death after a kidney transplant. Until more is known, avoid alpha-linolenic acid supplements. Prostate cancer . Alpha-linolenic acid might increase the chance of getting prostate cancer.

DSI005058,Vitamin,C0042890,"As a dietary supplement advertised on the Internet and elsewhere, Vitamin O is promoted to prevent and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS, cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, and other chronic illnesses by detoxifying the body and improving metabolism via high doses of molecular oxygen. It is purported to contain 30,000 ppm stabilized oxygen molecules in a solution of sodium chloride and distilled water. The anticancer activity of vitamin O is based on the theory that cancer cells grow in an oxygen-poor environment and cannot proliferate in oxygen-rich conditions. Vitamin O was advertised in national newspapers for mail-order purchase until the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a complaint against its marketers, Rose Creek Health Products, Inc., and Staff of Life, Inc., in March 1999. The FTC found, contrary to the advertisement claims, that Vitamin O does not allow oxygen molecules to be absorbed through the gastrointestinal system, does not prevent or treat any physical ailment or disease, does not have a beneficial effect on human health, has not been proven effective by medical or scientific research, and was not developed by NASA for use of astronauts . | Despite its name, vitamin O is not a vitamin. It claims to be a liquid form of oxygen that can be used as a medicine. However, vitamin O is more likely to be nothing more than water and minerals. The manufacturer of vitamin O was charged by the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for making unsupported claims about their product. In May 2000, they agreed to pay $375,000 to the FTC to settle these charges. People use vitamin O for conditions such as infections, depression, joint pain, stomach problems, and many others, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.",When taken by mouth : There isn't enough reliable information to know if vitamin O is safe or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if vitamin O is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.,"Supposed efficacy is based on the idea that most degenerative diseases result from decreased levels of atmospheric oxygen caused by industry and deforestation. Stress, toxins, and modern diets of processed foods, fats, sugar, alcohol, white flour, and caffeine are said to make the body oxygen-deficient because more oxygen is required to metabolize them (1).
Vitamin O marketers misappropriate the discovery of higher atmospheric oxygen levels in past geologic eras to conclude that the human body evolved to function at higher concentrations of oxygen than is now available; the dissolved oxygen content of most people’s bodies is considerably lower than that needed to maintain sufficient metabolism; and that the lower the level of dissolved oxygen in a person’s body, the greater the susceptibility to disease.
While supplemental respiratory oxygen is thought to have anticancer activities by enhancing T cells and NK cells (3), none of the claims on oral vitamin O supplement are supported by laboratory or clinical evidence.",,"Stabilized oxygen | Liquid Oxygen, Oxygène Liquide, Oxygène Liquide Stabilisé, Oxygène Stabilisé, Stabilized Liquid Oxygen, Stabilized Oxygen, Vitamina O, Vitamine O.",,Blend (Vitamin) | Proprietary Blend (Vitamin) | Vitamin (unspecified),Vitamin O,Vitamin O

DSI005068,Green Algae,C0002032,"Blue-green algae, also known as Cyanobacteria, are primitive autotrophic prokaryotes. They are a source of food in some parts of the world and patients take the supplemental forms to prevent and treat cancer, viral infections, and for weight loss. Spirulina species are cultured in alkaline fresh water whereas Aphanizomenon flos aquae (AFA) is naturally grown and harvested from Upper Klamath Lake, Oregon, USA. Blue-green algae products frequently contain one or both of these strains of algae. Small studies have shown that spirulina may be effective against allergic rhinitis ; for managing diabetes ; for lowering cholesterol in patients with nephrotic syndrome-induced hyperlipidemia ; for relief from chronic pain ; may benefit obese and overweight adults by reducing obesity indices ; benefit those with mild cognitive impairment ; and improve quality of life in ulcerative colitis patients . Spirulina may also be effective against chronic hepatitis C virus infection and adjunctive use, against oral lichen planus . Foods fortified with spirulina were found to help motor development and prevent morbidity due to upper respiratory infections in infants and positively affect development in children . Supplementation may benefit HIV patients via immunomodulatory effects and by reducing viral load . Animal models suggest that spirulina has chemo- and radioprotective effects , but human studies are lacking. It is important to note that blue-green algae may be contaminated by strains of algae (e.g. Microcystis species) that are toxic. | Blue-green algae are a group of bacteria. They can be used as a source of protein, but contain no more protein than meat or milk. Blue-green algae produce blue-green colored pigments and are high in protein, iron, and other minerals. They grow in saltwater and some large freshwater lakes. They have been used for food for several centuries in Mexico and some African countries. In the US, they've been sold in supplements since the late 1970s. People use blue-green algae for treating high blood pressure and as a protein supplement. It's also used for high levels of cholesterol or other fats (lipids) in the blood, diabetes, obesity, and many other conditions. But there is no good scientific evidence to support these other uses. Some blue-green algae products are grown under controlled conditions. Others are grown in a natural setting, where they're more likely to be contaminated. Only use products that have been tested and are free of contaminants such as heavy metals, liver toxins called microcystins, and harmful bacteria. Don't confuse blue-green algae with other algaes, like Ascophyllum nodosum, Ecklonia cava, Fucus Vesiculosis, or Laminaria.","When taken by mouth : Blue-green algae products that are free of contaminants are possibly safe for most people when used short-term. Doses up to 19 grams daily have been used safely for up to 2 months. Lower doses of 10 grams daily have been used safely for up to 6 months. Side effects are typically mild and may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness. But blue-green algae products that are contaminated are possibly unsafe. Contaminated blue-green algae can cause liver damage, vomiting, weakness, rapid heartbeat, shock, and death. Don't use any blue-green algae product that hasn't been tested and found to be free of microcystins and other contaminants. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough information available to know if it is safe to use blue-green algae when pregnant or breast-feeding. Contaminated blue-green algae products contain harmful toxins that might be transferred to an infant during pregnancy or through breast milk. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Blue-green algae are possibly unsafe for children. Children are more sensitive to contaminated blue-green algae products than adults. Auto-immune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), pemphigus vulgaris (a skin condition), and others : Blue-green algae might cause the immune system to become more active, and this could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using blue-green algae. Surgery : Blue-green algae might lower blood sugar levels. There is some concern that it might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop using blue-green algae at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Calcium spirulan, a polysaccharide extract from Spirulina platensis, demonstrates inhibition of HIV-1 viral replication via possible binding and disruption of CD4-gp120 interaction in vitro, although the clinical significance of this is unknown (15). Calcium spirulan also inhibits replication of herpes simplex I, cytomegalovirus, and influenza. Other studies showed that spirulina has chemoprotective and radioprotective effects in animals (6), affected by stimulation of the hemopoietic system.
Although uncommon, several toxins from Microcystis species of algae may contaminate AFA-algae and Spirulina algal blooms. Anatoxin can cause paralysis of respiratory muscles due to irreversible binding and sustained action of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Saxitoxin contamination is thought to block nerve cell neuronal transmission due to binding to voltage-gated sodium channels. Microcystins are cyclic heptapeptides that induce hepatotoxicity (9) (10).
Spirulina can significantly inhibit cytochrome P450 1A2 and 2E1 enzymes. The same study showed that it also led to significant increase in mRNA/protein levels of CYP2B1 and CYP3A1, but there was no change in the enzyme activities (20). Spirulina was shown to antagonize glioma cell growth in mice by down-regulating angiogenesis, which was mediated in part by regulating the production of interleukin (IL-17) (21).",,"Spirulina platensis | Spirulina fusiformis | AFA-algae; Arthrospira platensis; Tecuitlatl; BGA | AFA, Algae, Algas Verdiazul, Algues Bleu-Vert, Algues Bleu-Vert du Lac Klamath, Anabaena, Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, Arthrospira fusiformis, Arthrospira maxima, Arthrospira platensis, BGA, Blue Green Algae, Blue-Green Micro-Algae, Cyanobacteria, Cyanobactérie, Cyanophycée, Dihe, Espirulina, Hawaiian Spirulina, Klamath, Klamath Lake Algae, Lyngbya wollei, Microcystis aeruginosa and other Microcystis species, Nostoc ellipsosporum, Spirulina Blue-Green Algae, Spirulina fusiformis, Spirulina maxima, Spirulina platensis, Spiruline, Spiruline d'Hawaii, Tecuitlatl.",,Blue-Green Algae | Blue Green Algae | green algae (unspecified),Blue-green Algae,Blue-Green Algae

DSI005138,Dietary,C0012155,"The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, very low-carb diet. It usually limits carbs to 20-50 grams daily. This forces the body to break down fat for energy. The body breaks down fat into molecules called ketone bodies. These ketone bodies can be used for energy. The classical ketogenic diet, which is used to reduce seizures in children, requires up to 4 times as many calories from fat as from carbohydrate and protein. A very strict form of the ketogenic diet is used for seizure disorders in people with hard-to-treat epilepsy. Less strict forms of the ketogenic diet are used for obesity, diabetes, Parkinson disease, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. Don't confuse the Modified Atkins Diet, a type of ketogenic diet, with the Atkins diet. Also don't confuse the ketogenic diet with ""Keto diet pills."" These are not the same and don't have the same effects.","When taken by mouth : The ketogenic diet is likely safe for most adults when used for up to 1 year. The most common side effects include constipation, fatigue, dizziness, weakness, nausea, diarrhea, and stomach pain. The long-term safety of the ketogenic diet in adults is unknown. It is important to ensure any diet remains balanced and contains nutrient-rich foods. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : There isn't enough reliable information to know if the ketogenic diet is safe when pregnant. Ketone bodies are chemicals made in the body when people follow a ketogenic diet. There is some concern that these chemicals might pass to the baby and slow down growth during pregnancy and after birth. Don't follow this diet unless under the care of a healthcare professional. Breast-feeding : The ketogenic diet is possibly unsafe when breast-feeding. Following a very-low carbohydrate ketogenic diet when breast-feeding might increase the risk for a serious health issue called ketoacidosis. Don't follow this diet unless under the care of a healthcare professional. Children : The ketogenic diet is possibly safe when used by children under the care of a doctor, short-term. There is some concern about the ketogenic diet when used long-term. When used for more than 2 years, the ketogenic diet has been linked with slowed growth, fractures, and kidney stones in children. Heart conditions : Use with caution. The ketogenic diet might worsen certain heart conditions. Diabetes : Following a very-low carbohydrate ketogenic diet might increase the risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a serious complication of diabetes. If you have diabetes, speak with a healthcare professional before starting the ketogenic diet. Acid reflux : Some ketogenic diets are high in fat. High-fat diets can worsen symptoms of acid reflux. High levels of fat in the blood : Some ketogenic diets are high in fat. Diets high in fat can increase levels of cholesterol and other fats called triglycerides. This might be a problem for people who already have high levels of these fats in the blood. Talk to your doctor before starting the ketogenic diet. Liver disease : The ketogenic diet might cause liver injury and may worsen symptoms of liver disease. Problems breaking down fats in the diet : The ketogenic diet forces the body to break down fat for energy. For people unable to break down fat, the ketogenic diet might lead to serious adverse effects, including coma or death. Kidney disease : The ketogenic diet may worsen kidney disease and has been linked with kidney stone development. Weak and brittle bones (osteoporosis) : Long-term use of the ketogenic diet may weaken the bones. Use caution if you are at risk for or have a history of osteoporosis. Swelling (inflammation) of the pancreas (pancreatitis) : The ketogenic diet may increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. Use caution if you have a history of pancreatitis or have very high triglyceride levels. Surgery : Certain medications used during surgery contain carbohydrates. Talk to your healthcare provider before any surgery if you are using the ketogenic diet to reduce seizures. Changes to some medications used during surgery might be needed.",,,"Classical ketogenic Diet, Classic Long-Chain Triglyceride Ketogenic Diet, Keto Diet, Low Carbohydrate Diet, Low Glycemic Index Treatment, Medium Chain Triglyceride Diet, Modified Atkin's Diet, Very Low Carbohydrate Diet, Very-Low-Carbohydrate Ketogenic Diet.",,Blend (Dietary substance used by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake) | Proprietary Blend (Dietary substance used by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake),,Ketogenic diet

DSI005147,Butterbur,C1019150,"Butterbur is an herb native to Europe, Southwestern Asia, and North Africa, the leaf and root extracts of which have been used to treat allergies, bronchial asthma, headache, pain, and muscle and urinary tract spasms. Petasins, the sesquiterpene compounds found in butterbur, are thought to be the active constituents . Its leaf and root extracts have been shown effective in controlling migraines in adults and in children and asthma . Butterbur extract may also be effective against somatoform disorders . However, results from studies on allergic diseases are mixed. Some suggest that butterbur is effective against allergic rhinitis and comparable to standard antihistamine drugs , but conflicting data indicate that it is no better than placebo for intermittent rhinitis or for allergic skin disease . A systematic review suggests the need for more rigorous studies before recommending use of butterbur . Butterbur contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids that can cause hepatotoxicity . | Butterbur (Petasites hybridus) is a shrub. Its large leaves were used to wrap butter during warm weather, giving it the name ""butterbur"". Butterbur grows throughout Europe and parts of Asia. It's also now found in parts of the US. Butterbur contains chemicals that might relieve spasms and decrease swelling. Butterbur is used for migraine, hay fever, asthma, and many other conditions, but there is no strong scientific evidence to support most of these uses. Some butterbur products may contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs). These chemicals can harm the liver and cause serious side effects. Do not use butterbur products unless they are certified as free of PAs.","When taken by mouth : Butterbur products that do not contain pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are possibly safe when used for up to 16 weeks. Side effects might include belching, headache, itchy eyes, diarrhea, upset stomach, and drowsiness. Some butterbur products may contain PAs. These products are likely unsafe. PAs can damage the liver and lungs and possibly cause cancer. Do not use butterbur products unless they are certified as free of PAs. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if butterbur is safe to use or what the side effects might be. Butterbur products that contain PAs are likely unsafe when applied to broken skin. Do not use butterbur products unless they are certified as free of PAs. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if butterbur is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Butterbur products that contain dangerous chemicals called pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are likely unsafe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. PAs might cause birth defects and liver damage. Children : Butterbur products that do not contain PAs are possibly safe when taken by mouth appropriately. There is some evidence that a specific PA-free butterbur rhizome extract (Petadolex, Weber & Weber, GmbH & Co) can be safely used for up to 4 months in children aged 6-17 years. Allergy to ragweed and related plants : Butterbur may cause an allergic reaction in people who are sensitive to the Asteraceae/Compositae family. Members of this family include ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many others. If you have allergies, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before taking butterbur. Liver disease : Butterbur might make liver disease worse. Don't take butterbur if you have liver disease.","Sesquiterpene petasin inhibits leukotriene and histamine activities, and is thought responsible for butterbur’s anti-inflammatory and antiallergic effects (15). Petasins were also shown to have calcium channel blocking effects (18) making them effective for migraine prophylaxis (1). The vasorelaxation effects of petasin may be via direct Ca(2+) antagonism of L-type voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channel (VDCC) in vascular smooth muscle (21).
In another study, a butterbur extract showed dose-dependent inhibition effect on cyclooxygenase (COX2) and prostaglandin E2 in vitro that was not correlated to the petasin content (16).",,"Butterbur | Butter dock | Bog rhubarb | Exwort | pestilence wort | Devil's hat | Blatterdock, Bog Rhubarb, Bogshorns, Butter Bur, Butter-Dock, Butterfly Dock, Capdockin, Chapelière, Common Butterbur, Contre-Peste, Exwort, Feuille de Pétasite, Flapperdock,  Fleur de Pétasite, Grand Bonnet, Herbe à la Peste, Herbe aux Teigneux, Langwort, Pestwurz, Pétasite, Pétasite Hybride, Pétasite Officinal, Pétasite Vulgaire, Petasites, Petasites hybridus, Petasites officinalis, Petasites Vulgaris, Petasitidis Folium, Petasitidis Hybridus, Petasitidis Rhizoma,   Plague Root, Purple Butterbur, Racine de Pétasite, Rhizome de Pétasite, Tussilago hybrida, Umbrella Leaves.",,Butterbur,Butterbur,Butterbur

The seeds can expand and turn into a gel-like substance when mixed with water, and are often found in a variety of packaged goods touted as superfoods. Various laboratory analyses suggest that chia constituents have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antithrombotic activities . In vivo experiments suggest that dietary consumption of chia seeds may improve animal intestinal health . In animal studies, chia prevented onset of dyslipidemia , reversed insulin resistance , and conferred cardio- and hepatoprotective effects . However, it did not reduce body weight gain or abdominal fat accumulation , or have preventive effects in animal tumor models . In preliminary clinical studies, chia did not benefit overweight adults , but appeared to improve cardiovascular and obesity-related risk factors in patients with type 2 diabetes . Other small studies suggest chia supplementation may increase short-term satiety , perhaps to a greater extent than flax , and has positive effects on blood glucose levels . Chia flour supplementation was found to reduce blood pressure in both treated and untreated hypertensive subjects . However, a systematic review determined that most studies on chia for CVD risk factors did not demonstrate statistically significant results . In addition, a meta-analysis of trials evaluating chia for various metabolic parameters determined that results were largely nonsignificant and modest at best for a few subgroup measures, while citing low quality of evidence . More research is needed to elucidate and validate health benefits with chia supplementation.

It's grown for its seed, a source of omega-3 fatty acids. In addition to omega-3 fatty acids such as alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), chia seeds contain a large amount of dietary fiber. Omega-3 fatty acids and dietary fiber might help reduce risk factors for heart disease. People use chia seed for diabetes, athletic performance, high blood pressure, heart disease, itching, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Chia is commonly consumed in foods.

DSI005282,Conjugated Linoleic Acid,C1257880,"Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) is a naturally occurring fatty acid found in the milk and meat of ruminant animals . CLA supplements have been marketed for weight control and to lower high cholesterol. Other purported uses include cancer prevention. CLA has different isomers that appear to have distinct characteristics, with anticarcinogenic effects more likely attributable to cis-9,trans-11 and antiobesity effects attributable to the trans-10,cis-12 isomer.In humans, studies on potential benefits are mixed. Preliminary data suggest CLA supplementation may improve some markers related to bone health in patients with rheumatoid arthritis . Other small studies suggest some benefit in COPD , as an adjunct to usual care in mild asthmatics , or antithrombotic or antiatherosclerotic effects in overweight adults . However, cis-9,trans-11 CLA supplementation decreased insulin sensitivity in obese men at high risk for cardiovascular disease , and short-term high-CLA intake did not affect blood pressure regulation in healthy volunteers . Another study also suggests no effects on antioxidant metabolism in overweight/obese individuals , and meta-analyses indicate proinflammatory effects . And although data suggest CLA can lower triacylglycerol levels , other studies indicate it can increase lipoprotein a and total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, and lower HDL levels .Preliminary studies on CLA-induced changes in body composition and weight reduction are also mixed, with some yielding positive results while others do not show benefits . Although meta-analyses suggest effects on serum leptin levels in certain subgroups , it did not affect fasting blood glucose or waist circumference in healthy adults . CLA also did not impact aerobic capacity , aerobically-induced neuromuscular fatigue , or exercise performance .Animal studies suggest that CLA may play a role in reducing tumor proliferation in certain cancer cell lines . In models of colorectal cancer, CLA reduced inflammation and decreased disease activity . Preliminary human studies suggest anticancer effects with CLA in colorectal and breast cancers, but a meta-analysis found no association between CLA intake and reduced breast cancer risk . More studies in the context of clinical trials are needed. | Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a type of fat. Dairy and beef are major sources of CLA in the diet. Most CLA supplements are made from safflower oil. CLA might help reduce body fat deposits and improve immune function. The average diet supplies 15-174 mg of CLA daily. People commonly take CLA by mouth for weight loss. It is also often used for bodybuilding and fitness, but there is limited scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : CLA is likely safe when taken in amounts normally found in foods, such as milk and beef. It is possibly safe when taken in larger amounts as medicine. It might cause side effects such as stomach upset, diarrhea, nausea, fatigue, and headache. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : CLA is likely safe when taken by mouth in amounts normally found in foods. But there isn't enough reliable information to know if CLA is safe to use in larger amounts when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : CLA is likely safe when taken by mouth in amounts normally found in foods. CLA supplements are possibly safe for children when taken by mouth for up to 7 months. There isn't enough reliable information to know if long-term use of supplements is safe. Bleeding disorders . CLA supplements might slow blood clotting. In theory, CLA might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding in people with bleeding disorders. Diabetes : There are concerns that taking CLA supplements can worsen diabetes. Avoid use. Metabolic syndrome : There are concerns that taking CLA supplements might increase the risk of getting diabetes if you have metabolic syndrome. Use cautiously. Surgery : CLA supplements might cause extra bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using it at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Of several possible CLA isomers, cis-9,trans-11 and trans-10,cis-12 are the main isomers found in meat and dairy products, as well as commercial supplements. They appear to have distinct characteristics, with anticarcinogenic effects more likely attributable to cis-9,trans-11 and antiobesity effects attributable to trans-10,cis-12 (23).CLA reduced prostaglandin synthesis, especially PGE2 (12) (13), and decreased stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity (14). The trans-10,cis-12 isomer decreased serum HDL cholesterol levels (9), inhibited stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity (12), and decreased insulin-like growth factor-II secretion at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (18).Laboratory and animal studies suggest that CLA has both anti- and pro-oxidant effects (40) (41). CLA may reduce abdominal adiposity through increased energy expenditure, while myocardial oxidative stress may occur through changes in transmembrane potential or the antioxidant defense system (40).In humans, CLA appeared to have a synergistic effect with a mixture of oleic and erucic acids in reducing neuroinflammation and enhancing peroxisomal beta-oxidation (42). In human skeletal muscle, CLA enhanced the rate of glycogen resynthesis after exercise (43).It is thought that replacing other polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with CLA may reduce oxidative stress and modulate intracellular signaling (11). These effects may inhibit carcinogenesis and affect cellular responses to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) (15). In vitro, CLA inhibited MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation, but the mechanisms by which this occurred for both isomers (trans-10,cis-12 and cis-9,trans-11) differed and require future elucidation (3). The cis-9,trans-11 isomer induced tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 mRNA in SGC-7901 human gastric carcinoma cells, which may play a role in inhibiting the tumor metastasis cascade (2). This inhibition may come from blocking the cell cycle with reduced expressions of cyclin A, B1 and D1 and enhanced cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) expression (17).In animal models of colorectal cancer, suppression of disease activity was attributed to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARy) activation (36). Other possible mechanisms include increased apoptosis and enhanced caspase-3 activity in the colon mucosa (37). Preliminary studies in human breast cancers suggest anticancer effects occurred through suppression of fatty acid synthesis (39). In rectal cancer, CLA supplementation may improve markers of inflammation, and reduce angiogenesis and tumor invasion via matrix metalloproteinase-9 inhibition (38) (44).",Meat and dairy products,"CLA | Acide Linoléique Conjugué, Acide Linoléique Conjugué Cis-9,trans-11, Acide Linoléique Conjugué trans-10,cis-12, Acido Linoleico Conjugado, ALC, Cis-9,trans-11 Conjugated Linoleic Acid, Cis-Linoleic Acid, CLA, CLA-Free Fatty Acid, CLA-Triacylglycerol, LA, Linoleic Acid, Trans-10,cis-12 Conjugated Linoleic Acid.",,Conjugated Linoleic Acid | Conjugated Linolenic Acid,Conjugated Linoleic Acid,Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA)

DSI005305,Cordyceps,,"Found in cold climates, cordyceps refers to the complex of a parasitic fungus that grows on the larvae of the moth Hepialus armoricanus Oberthuer. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine for a wide range of conditions including fatigue, sexual dysfunction, coughs, and as an adaptogen or immune stimulant. Preclinical studies show antitumor , radioprotective , antiplatelet and antidiabetic effects . In addition, cordyceps enhances recovery of mice with taxol-induced leukopenia and increases the cytotoxicity of cisplatin in non-small cell lung cancer cells . In clinical studies, cordyceps products improved renal function and reduced nephropathy in renal transplant patients and diabetes patients with renal insufficiency undergoing coronary angiography . However, several analyses found that evidence for its utility as adjuvant treatment in renal transplant recipients and hemodialysis patients is insufficient . Studies on exercise performance in healthy subjects yielded mixed results . Cordyceps may increase the adverse effects of antidiabetic or anticoagulant/antiplatelet drugs. Animal studies showed proliferation of progenitor red blood cells with cordyceps . Therefore, it should not be used by those with myelogenous type cancers. Cordyceps also stimulated testosterone production in mice . Whether it exerts similar effects in humans is not known. | Cordyceps is a fungus that lives on certain caterpillars in the high mountain regions of China. It is sometimes used as a medicine. Most supplements use cordyceps that is made in a lab. Although cordyceps is sometimes called a mushroom, the type of cordyceps that is made in a lab does not grow a mushroom. Cordyceps might improve immunity by stimulating cells and specific chemicals in the immune system. It might also help fight cancer cells and shrink tumor size, particularly with lung or skin cancers. Natural cordyceps is hard to get and might be expensive. People most commonly use cordyceps for athletic performance, kidney disorders, liver problems, and sexual problems, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Cordyceps is possibly safe for most people when taken in doses of 3-6 grams daily for up to 1 year. It might cause mild side effects such as diarrhea, constipation, and stomach discomfort. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if cordyceps is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding or what the side effects might be. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. ""Auto-immune diseases"" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions : When taken by mouth, cordyceps might cause the immune system to become more active. This could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using cordyceps. Surgery : When taken by mouth, cordyceps might increase the risk of bleeding during surgery. Stop taking cordyceps 2 weeks before surgery.","Laboratory studies demonstrate that cordyceps stimulates T helper cells, prolongs lymphocyte survival, enhances TNF-alpha and IL1 production, and increases activity of NK cells (3). Enhanced proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells in murine bone marrow (8) and increased progesterone production in animal cells (5) have also been shown. Other experiments suggest cordyceps may inhibit tumor celIs by downregulating MHC class II antigen expression (7). Anecdotal data suggest reduction of cyclosporin and aminoglycoside-induced renal toxicity, although the mechanism of action is not known (4). Cordycepin, an active constituent in cordyceps, inhibits collagen-induced platelet aggregation by lowering calcium ion and thromboxane A2 activities (19).",,"Vegetable caterpillar | Chinese caterpillar fungus | Dong chong xia cao | Semitake | Hsia ts'ao tung ch'ung | Yarsha gumba | Bailing, Caterpillar Fungus, Caterpillar Mushroom, Cs-4, Champignon Chenille, Chinese Caterpillar Fungus, Chinese Cordyceps Fungus, Cordyceps sinensis, Dong Chong Xia Cao, Dong Chong Zia Cao, Hsia Ts'Ao Tung Ch'Ung, Hirsutella sinensis, Jinshuibao Jiaonang, Jinshuibao Pian, Ophiocordyceps sinensis, Tochukaso, Vegetable Caterpillar.",,Cordyceps,Cordyceps,Cordyceps

Traditionally, it is used as a gargle for laryngitis and orally as a gastrointestinal stimulant. Oral formulations are marketed largely for digestive and circulatory problems, poor appetite, and weight loss. The active component, capsaicin, is also marketed for topical use to relieve various types of pain and for certain skin conditions (See Capsaicin topical formulations). Capsaicin may increase insulin and decrease blood glucose levels . Nonpungent capsaicin analogues can produce a stimulatory effect in humans, but their potential role in energy expenditure and weight management problems needs further clarification . In addition, the thermogenic and appetitive effects of capsaicin have been determined to be small . Oral capsaicin administered to participants in one study enhanced salty taste sensations, thereby lowering daily salt intake and subsequent blood pressure but a systematic review found no impact on blood pressure or heart rate . A preliminary study of enteric-coated oral capsaicin suggests it may decrease visceral hyperalgesia and improve bloating in patients with irritable bowel syndrome , but supplementation with capsicum for burning mouth syndrome was associated with significant GI side effects . Another study of oral capsaicin suggests it can alleviate oral mucositis pain from cancer therapy, but this relief was temporary and not complete . There is continued controversy over whether active constituents of capsicum act as a carcinogen, co-carcinogen, or anti-carcinogen , and effects may be concentration-dependent . In vitro studies have shown cytotoxic effects against breast , bladder , prostate , and oral cancer cell lines , and multidrug-resistant lymphoma . However, a human case-control study suggests an increased risk for gastric cancer with dietary capsaicin . Therefore, more studies are needed to clarify the roles of capsaicin in relationship to cancer.",,"Capsaicin is the compound responsible for the irritant effects of capsicum (10). Perceived heat from capsaicin when ingesting cayenne is caused by activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid subfamily member 1 (TRPV1), located in neurons on the tongue (4). Capsinoids lack this sensory quality because they are hydrolyzed as they cross the oral mucosa (4). Potential thermogenic effects also involve TRPV1-receptor activation on vagal afferents in the gut (4). Capsaicin may induce energy expenditure by enhancing core body and skin temperature and influencing substrate oxidation, but these effects can vary with body composition (3) (5). In response to high-salt stimuli, oral capsaicin administration enhanced insula and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) metabolic activity in participants, reversing salt intensity-dependent differences in the metabolism of the insula and OFC (29).
Vasodilator effects are attributed to the release of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Depletion in CGRP leads to a subsequent increase in blood pressure (21). Interactions between capsaicin and cyclosporin suggest modulation of P-gp and CYP3A gene expression and increased cyclosporin bioavailability via CYP3A inhibition (22). Lignan glycosides isolated from capsicum pepper appear to have strong scavenging activity against free radicals (20).
In vitro and animal studies suggest capsaicin causes cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in both ER+ and ER− breast cancer cells by modulating the EGFR/HER-2 pathway (13). Orally administered capsaicin slowed prostate cancer cell growth by downregulating androgen receptor expression and inhibiting PSA transcription (15). In bladder cancer, capsaicin mediates cell death through ROS production and mitochondrial depolarization (14). Conversely in certain concentrations, capsaicin may promote colorectal metastasis by triggering ROS production and modulating Akt/mTOR and STAT-3 pathways (9).",Fruits of capsicum pepper,Capsicum | Red peppers | African chilies | Tabasco peppers | Mexican chilies | Louisiana long pepper | Pimiento,,Cayenne,Cayenne,

Native Americans used extracts and preparations from this plant to treat skin sores, diabetes, cancer, venereal disease, tuberculosis, colds, and rheumatism. The aqueous extract, known as chaparral tea, has been employed for the treatment of kidney and gallbladder stones. A phase II clinical trial found chaparral to be ineffective as an anticancer agent . In another small retrospective study, low intake of chaparral tincture (<10%) did not cause adverse effects , but the association between length of exposure and risk is not known. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), the active compound isolated from chaparral, has been investigated for its biological effects. In preclinical studies, it demonstrated antioxidant , anticancer , antiviral , antiparastitic , neuroprotective and renoprotective properties. It also had a protective effect against diet-induced metabolic function . However, studies in humans are quite limited. One pilot in patients with relapsed prostate cancer suggested NDGA was reasonably well tolerated and affected increases in PSA doubling time, but it was also associated with transaminitis in some patients . Several cases of reversible and irreversible liver damage have been associated with chaparral and products containing chaparral. NDGA, formerly employed as a food additive in low concentrations, has been removed by the FDA from its “Generally Recognized as Safe” (GRAS) substances list . Also Masoprocol, a topical cream containing NDGA for the treatment of actinic keratoses, was withdrawn from the US market in June 1996 .

Cassava root and leaves are eaten as food. The nutritional value of cassava is similar to a potato. However, cassava contains chemicals called cyanogenic glycosides. These chemicals can release cyanide in the body. Cassava must be prepared correctly before eating to prevent cyanide poisoning. | Tapioca is a starch that comes from the cassava plant (Manihot esculenta). It is used to thicken foods such as puddings, noodles, bread, and others. Tapioca starch is prepared by cooking cassava, drying it, processing it, and then cooking it again. When eaten, tapioca takes longer for the body to break down into sugar when compared to other grains or carbohydrates. This might help lower blood sugar levels after eating. People use tapioca for prediabetes and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse tapioca with cassava. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : Cassava that has been prepared properly is LIKELY SAFE for most people when eaten occasionally in normal food amounts.

Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : It's POSSIBLY UNSAFE to eat cassava regularly as part of the diet if you are pregnant. It might cause birth defects. It is also POSSIBLY UNSAFE to insert cassava into the vagina. It might cause the uterus to contract. This might cause a miscarriage. Cassava is POSSIBLY UNSAFE to eat regularly as part of the diet when breast-feeding. Eating cassava might expose the infant to chemicals that can affect thyroid function. Children : Cassava is POSSIBLY SAFE for children when eaten occasionally in normal food amounts. However, cassava contains chemicals that can cause certain paralysis conditions. Children are more prone to these adverse effects than adults. Also, eating cassava regularly has been linked to low blood levels of certain vitamins in children. Cassava is POSSIBLY UNSAFE when eaten regularly as a food in large amounts. Children who eat large amounts of cassava may have a higher chance of developing certain paralysis conditions. Allergies to latex : Cassava might cause an allergic reaction in people who are sensitive to latex. Iodine deficiency : Cassava might lower the amount of iodine absorbed by the body. For people who already have low levels of iodine, eating cassava might make this condition worse. Protein deficiency : Cassava contains chemicals that can cause serious side effects.

DSI005633,dhea,C0011185,"The most abundant hormone secreted by the adrenal glands, DHEA circulates in the blood as the sulfate ester, dehydroepiandrosterone-3-sulfate (DHEA-S). Both are precursors for other hormones, including estrogen and androgens . DHEA showed chemopreventive effects ; blocked the development of tumors ; and enhanced immune responses following hepatitis and influenza vaccinations in animal models. Although it has been postulated that DHEA may play a role in increasing immune response in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) , no antiviral or immunostimulatory effects were observed in HIV-positive participants receiving DHEA . DHEA was reported effective in treating Addison’s disease , major depression , schizophrenia-induced anxiety , systematic lupus erythematosus , erectile dysfunction and osteoporosis . Additionally, low serum DHEA-S levels were found to indicate risk of non-vertebral fractures in older men . Topical application of DHEA in postmenopausal women increased sebum production and epidermal thickening in the hands and face , and oral use increased circulating estradiol levels . However, DHEA was ineffective in treating Alzheimer’s disease , obesity in adolescents , or perimenopausal symptoms . It also did not increase muscle mass or physical performance , improve cognitive performance , or enhance insulin secretion or action in elderly individuals. Supplementation, believed to enhance physical strength, did not improve physical performance or quality of life in a study done in older men and women . Conflicting data, however, suggest improvements in cognitive and physical function in older women. Findings also suggest DHEA may protect against hypoglycemia-associated neuroendocrine and autonomic failure and higher levels were associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events .Studies on DHEA’s effects on sexual dysfunction in postmenopausal women are mixed . A review determined DHEA does not improve cognitive performance in this population but improved dyspareunia/genitourinary syndrome in menopausal women and in female cancer survivors , and conferred positive effects on vaginal cytology in postmenopausal women with breast or gynecologic cancers . Whether or not DHEA is effective in treating adrenal insufficiency remains unclear .Higher levels of DHEA have been associated with increased risk of ovarian and breast cancers in premenopausal women. Also, elevated DHEA-S levels contributed to tamoxifen resistance and disease progression in breast cancer . A case of cancer flare-up was reported in a patient with advanced prostate cancer undergoing DHEA treatment . In patients receiving androgen depletion treatment for recurrent prostate cancer, increases in serum DHEA and androsterone (AST) were associated with shorter time to castration-resistant prostate cancer . | 19-nor-DHEA is a type of chemical known as a ""prohormone."" These chemicals are changed by the body to other ""muscle-building"" hormones such as testosterone. Very little is known about the safety of 19-nor-DHEA. There is concern it might cause serious side effects similar to those caused by other ""muscle-building"" hormones. 19-nor-DHEA is included as an ingredient in a variety of supplements marketed to athletes and bodybuilders. | 7-alpha-hydroxy-DHEA is a by-product of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) that is made in the body. DHEA is a ""parent"" hormone made by glands near the kidneys. 7-alpha-hydroxy-DHEA levels in the body get lower with age, so there's interest in using supplements to slow aging. 7-alpha-hydroxy-DHEA might also stimulate the immune system and might act like an antioxidant. People take 7-alpha-hydroxy-DHEA for aging, obesity, muscle strength, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. This chemical is also banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Don't confuse 7-alpha-hydroxy-DHEA with 7-beta-hydroxy-DHEA, 7-keto-DHEA, or DHEA. These are not the same. | 7-beta-hydroxy-DHEA is a type of chemical known as an anabolic steroid. It is converted in the body to testosterone and other sex hormones. In the U.S., it is illegal to include anabolic steroids in supplement products. These chemicals are also banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). 7-beta-hydroxy-DHEA is used for weight loss, to improve athletic performance, to reduce sexual problems, and for many other uses, but there is no good scientific evidence to support its use. 7-beta-hydroxy-DHEA might also be unsafe. | 7-keto-DHEA is formed from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in the body. DHEA is a ""parent hormone"" produced by glands near the kidneys. But unlike DHEA, 7-keto-DHEA is not converted to steroid hormones such as androgen and estrogen. Taking 7-keto-DHEA by mouth or applying it to the skin does not increase the level of steroid hormones in the blood. People take 7-keto-DHEA for obesity, muscle strength, anxiety, depression, and other conditions. But there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. | Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a hormone that is turned into male and female sex hormones in the body. Prescription DHEA is used to treat thin vaginal tissue. DHEA is made by the adrenal glands and by the liver. DHEA levels seem to go down as people get older. DHEA levels seem to be lower in people with depression and after menopause. People commonly use prescription DHEA for vaginal tissue thinning. DHEA supplements are used for aging skin, depression, infertility, muscle strength, heart disease, erectile dysfunction (ED), and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses. DHEA is banned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the International Olympic Committee, and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Don't confuse DHEA with 7-alpha-hydroxy-DHEA, 7-beta-hydroxy-DHEA, and 7-keto-DHEA. These are all different forms of DHEA but are not the same as DHEA.","When taken by mouth : 19-nor-DHEA is POSSIBLY UNSAFE . 19-nor-DHEA is changed by the body to other ""muscle building"" hormones such as testosterone. There is concern 19-nor-DHEA might cause serious side effects similar to those caused by other ""muscle-building"" hormones. These serious side effects might include liver damage, kidney damage, and also stroke. Special Precautions and Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking 19-nor-DHEA if you are pregnant or breast feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Heart disease : 19-nor-DHEA might worsen heart disease in some patients.

Side effects include infertility, behavioral changes, hair loss, and breast development (in men). 7-beta-hydroxy-DHEA can also lead to liver damage and heart disease. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : 7-beta-hydroxy-DHEA is POSSIBLY UNSAFE for women who are pregnant or breast-feeding. Avoid using. | When taken by mouth : 7-keto-DHEA is POSSIBLY SAFE when taken by mouth for up to 8 weeks. It might cause mild side effects such as nausea, dizziness, or low blood pressure in some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if 7-keto-DHEA is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. | When taken by mouth : DHEA is possibly safe when used short-term. DHEA has been used safely for up to 2 years, usually in doses of 50 mg daily. DHEA side effects are usually mild and might include acne and upset stomach. DHEA is possibly unsafe when used in high doses or long-term. Do not use DHEA in doses higher than 50-100 mg daily or for a long period of time. Using higher doses or using it long-term can increase the risk of serious side effects including cancer. When applied to the skin : DHEA is possibly safe when used appropriately. DHEA cream has been used safely for up to 1 year. When applied into the vagina : DHEA is possibly safe when used appropriately. DHEA vaginal inserts have been safely used for up to 3 months. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : DHEA is possibly unsafe when taken during pregnancy or breast-feeding. It can cause higher than normal levels of a male hormone called androgen. This might be harmful to the baby. Do not use DHEA if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Diabetes : DHEA can affect how insulin works in the body. If you have diabetes, monitor your blood sugar carefully if you are taking DHEA. Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : DHEA is a hormone that can affect how estrogen works in the body. If you have any condition that might be made worse by estrogen, do not use DHEA. High cholesterol : DHEA might lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL or ""good"") cholesterol, especially in females. If you have high cholesterol or heart disease, talk with your healthcare provider before taking DHEA. Liver problems : DHEA might make liver problems worse. Do not use DHEA if you have liver problems. Depression and mood disorders : DHEA might cause excitability, impulsiveness, and irritability in people with mood disorders. If you have a mood disorder, talk to your healthcare provider before taking DHEA. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) : Taking DHEA might make this condition worse. Don't use DHEA if you have PCOS.","DHEA is an endogenous hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex in response to adrenocorticotropin. DHEA is metabolized into androstenedione in the body and may be further converted into either testosterone or estrogen. Low levels of endogenous DHEA have been associated with the following disease states: burn trauma, coronary artery disease, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, obsessive-compulsive disorder, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus (5). Endogenous DHEA concentration peaks around 20 years of age and declines with age.DHEA has been shown to stimulate insulin growth factor-1 (1). G6PD is necessary for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) production. DHEA has also been shown to increase levels of interleukin-2 in animal models (7). DHEA reduces the effects of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6, which are thought to reduce flares in systemic lupus erythematosus (11). Numerous studies have reported an inverse relationship between DHEA concentration and cardiovascular disease (5). DHEA administration improved mental function scores in patients with advanced HIV infection (32), enhanced influenza vaccination in elderly patients (6), and decreased oxidative stress markers in patients with type II diabetes in part by negatively influencing TNF-alpha signaling (33). Although DHEA-S concentration does not appear to be correlated with cognitive decline in aging men (34), the anti-depressive effects of DHEA may be mediated by GABAA receptor modulation (35). DHEA has also been shown to affect cytochrome P-450 enzymes in the liver (3). The exact effect that this will have on other drugs remains unclear.Analogs of DHEA that cannot be converted to androgens and estrogens have been developed and have demonstrated anti-proliferative effects (7) (31). DHEA inhibits glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in vitro and blocks the development of tumors in mice (4). It was also shown to induce authophagic cell death in human hepatoma cells via a mitogen activated protein kinase (JNK)-transciption factor (Nrf2)-protein complex p62 axis (46).But an increase in concentration of sex hormones including DHEA has been shown to increase the risk of breast cancer (30). And prolonged intake of DHEA in postmenopausal women may increase the risk of breast cancer particularly in obese subjects (36). The sulfate ester DHEA-S also stimulates estrogen receptor-positive cell growth (28).",,"DHEA | 19-N-Andro, 19-nor-4-androstene-3,17-dione, 19-nor-A-dione, 19-Norandrostenedione, 19nor-dehydroepiandrosterone, 19-nor-dehydroepiandrosterone, 19nor-DHEA, 19-Nordéhydroépiandrostérone, 19-Norandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione, Estr-4-ene-3,17-dione. | 3-beta-7-alpha-dihydroxy-5-androstene-17-one, 7a-Hydroxy-Dehydroepiandrosterone, 7-Alfa-Hidroxi-DHEA, 7-Alpha-Hydroxy-Dehydroepiandrosterone, 7-Alpha-Hydroxy-DHEA, 7-Alpha-OH-DHEA, 7-Hydroxy-Dehydroepiandrosterone, 7-Hydroxy DHEA, 7-OH-DHEA. | 3b,7b-dihydroxy-5-Etioallocholen-17-one; 3b,7b-dihydroxy-5-androsten-17-one, 7b-hydroxy-DHEA, 7b-Hydroxydehydroepiandrosterone, 7-Beta-OH-DHEA. | (3-beta)-3-hydroxyandrost-5-ene-7,17-dione; (3S,8R,9S,10R,13R,14S)-3-hydroxy-10,13-dimethyl-2,3,4,8,9,11,12,14,15,16-decahydro-1H-cyclopenta[a]phenanthrene-7,17-dione,

DSI005678,Dong Quai,C1122975,"Dong quai is an herb, the root of which has a long history of use in traditional Chinese medicine. It is often combined with other herbs in formulations. Dong quai is also available as a dietary supplement and is promoted as a woman’s herb for menstrual and menopausal symptoms. Dong quai extracts demonstrated antitumor , pro-apoptotic , anti-metastatic , anti-tuberculosis (TB) , neuroprotective , and hematopoeitic effects in vitro. In animal models, polysaccharides extracted from dong quai root showed protective effects against cyclophosphamide-induced toxicity , doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity , and radiation-induced pneumonitis . Formulas containing dong quai improved clinical outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome and mild-to-moderate renal insufficiency , and prevented radiation-induced dermatitis in breast cancer patients . A systematic review determined benefits of dong quai against amenorrhea induced by antipsychotic drugs . Epidemiological data suggest positive associations between dong quai use and reduced risks of overall diabetes-related mortalities , and subsequent endometrial cancer in breast cancer survivors . Findings of its effectiveness against menopausal symptoms are inconclusive . Dong quai was also ineffective against hot flashes in men . Of note, dong quai showed estrogenic activity in vitro , stimulated proliferation of MCF-7 cells , and promoted growth of estrogen receptor-positive breast tumors in a murine model . Patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should consult with their physicians before using this herb. | Dong quai (Angelica sinensis) is a plant that has been used for a variety of conditions, with little evidence. It may be unsafe when too much is consumed. Dong quai is a member of the same plant family as parsley, celery, and carrots. It's popular in Chinese medicine for female health concerns. The root might affect estrogen and other hormones. People commonly use dong quai for menopausal symptoms, menstrual cramps, migraine, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Dong quai is possibly safe when taken for up to 6 months. It's been safely used in combination with other ingredients in doses up to 150 mg daily. It might make the skin extra sensitive to sunlight. Common side effects include burping, gas, and high blood pressure. Taking dong quai in higher doses for more than 6 months is possibly unsafe. Dong quai contains chemicals that might cause cancer. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if dong quai is safe or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Taking dong quai by mouth during pregnancy is possibly unsafe for the baby. Dong quai seems to affect the uterus. Some research suggests that taking dong quai with other herbs during the first 3 months of pregnancy can increase the risk of birth defects. Do not use dong quai if you are pregnant. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if dong quai is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Bleeding disorders . Dong quai might slow blood clotting and increase the chance of bruising and bleeding in people with bleeding disorders. Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Dong quai might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by estrogen, don't use dong quai. Surgery : Dong quai might slow blood clotting. It might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop taking dong quai at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Ferulic acid, a constituent of dong quai, may play an important role in treating osteoarthritis by reducing hydrogen peroxide-induced interleukin IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor TNF-alpha, matrix metalloproteinases MMP-1 and MMP-13, and by increasing SOX9 gene expression. SOX9 is a protein involved in the establishment and maintenance of the phenotype of chondrocytes  (35). Dong quai polysaccharides demonstrated anti-osteoarthritic activity by stimulating insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) and IGF1 receptor gene expression, thereby promoting UDP-sugars and glycosaminoglycan synthesis (37). Another compound promotes wound healing and bone regeneration by inducing osteoblast proliferation and hyaluronic acid deposition (25).An aqueous extract from dong quai showed estrogen-agonist activity, and stimulated proliferation of both estrogen receptor-positive and -negative breast cancer cells (17). It also protected against radiation-induced pneumonitis by downregulating proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 in a murine model (14). Subcutaneous injection of dong quai extract protected mice against cyclophosphamide-induced cytotoxicity by promoting recovery from leukopenia (12). The antitumor effects of dong quai may be due to its inhibitory effects on invasion and metastasis of carcinoma cells (9) and by suppression of tumor growth (7) (8) (10) that may be mediated by Nur77-dependent apoptosis (23) (24). However, dong quai extracts also promoted angiogenesis – which plays a key role in both physiologic and disease processes – by inducing proliferation and migration of endothelial cells by upregulating VEGF expression (26).",,"Chinese angelica | Dang gui | Tang kuei | Tan kue | Female ginseng | Angelica China, Angelica sinensis, Angelica polymorpha var. sinensis, Angelicae Gigantis Radix, Angélique Chinoise, Angélique de Chine, Chinese Angelica, Dang Gui, Danggui, Danguia, Dang Gui Shen, Dang Gui Tou, Dang Gui Wei, Don Quai, Female Ginseng, Kinesisk Kvan, Ligustilides, Radix Angelicae Gigantis, Radix Angelicae Sinensis, Tang Kuei, Tan Kue Bai Zhi, Tanggwi, Toki.",,Dong Quai,Dong Quai,Dong Quai

It is found naturally in plant and animal cells and in certain foods such as beans, cereal grains, brown rice, pumpkin seeds, and liver. DMG is produced in cells during the metabolism of choline and is considered an antioxidant and enhancer of oxygenation at the cellular level . Choline and DMG are present at higher levels in fetal versus maternal plasma . Plasma DMG levels have been found to be lower in children with cystic fibrosis than in healthy children . Animal studies on whether DMG can enhance immune response are mixed . Data in humans are also quite limited. A few studies suggest DMG may help enhance both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses . However, DMG had no effect on oxygen consumption in children with SLSJ-COX deficiency , and its use to treat seizures or autism stays controversial as limited clinical trials have yielded mixed results . In addition, a systematic review of supplements found no effects with DMG for autism symptoms . In a small long-term trial of patients with progressive multiple sclerosis, oral DMG also did not improve fatigue, cognition, gait performance, or disability status . DMG should not be confused with trimethylglycine (betaine), which is involved in the methylation of homocysteine to form methionine. | Dimethylglycine (DMG) is an amino acid, a building block for protein. The body needs dimethylglycine to function. Dimethylglycine is an essential amino acid, which means that the body cannot make this chemical on its own. It must be consumed in the diet. It is found in grains and meats and can also be taken as a supplement. People use dimethylglycine for aging, athletic performance, memory and thinking skills (cognitive function), and many other purposes, but there is no scientific evidence to support its use.","When taken by mouth : Dimethylglycine is possibly safe when used short-term, for up to 28 days. The safety of long-term use is unknown. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding: There isn’t enough reliable information to know if dimethylglycine is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.","Choline and DMG are present at higher levels in fetal versus maternal plasma, suggesting that choline provides glycine via DMG for glutathione synthesis in fetal development (3).
Enhanced physical performance in animals with DMG supplementation may occur via improved oxygen utilization and reduced lactic acid formation. In humans, it is thought to enhance humoral and cell-mediated immune responses (2). No mechanisms have been uncovered to elucidate claims of DMG for autism, ADHD, epilepsy, chronic fatigue syndrome, or athletic performance enhancement. A recent metabolic analysis of healthy subjects correlated high plasma cholesterol levels with low levels for some metabolites related to mitochondrial metabolism including dimethylglycine (9).
DMG has been used as an ester to increase the solubility and bioavailability of a prodrug used in cancer research (10).

It was shown to inhibit the production of inflammatory cytokines including interleukins IL-1beta, IL-6, and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) in mouse macrophage cells (15). A devil’s claw extract also demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity via inhibiting the induction of pro-inflammatory gene expression, possibly by blocking the activator protein (AP-1, a transcription factor) pathway (9).
Harpagide may also prevent bone loss by regulating the stimulation of osteoblast differentiation and the suppression of osteoclast formation in  mice (17).

It is commonly consumed in low doses and in combination with other herbs to promote urination, to treat asthma, bronchitis and coughs. Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, the major constituents, are non-selective sympathomimetic agents with both alpha and beta activities, and have direct as well as indirect central nervous system (CNS) stimulation effects, which account for the medicinal properties of the herb. In preclinical models, ephedra demonstrated antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties . Although ephedra is widely promoted as a natural stimulant and as an appetite suppressant, a systematic review cited insufficient evidence to support its use for weight loss . Additional preliminary data suggest an ephedrine alkaloids-free ephedra extract may be safer compared to ephedra extract, which causes adverse effects such as excitation, insomnia, and arrhythmias , and a formula containing ephedra used alone or combined with NSAIDs reduced disease activity in active ankylosing spondylitis patients . Misuse and overdose of ephedra have resulted in heart attack, stroke, seizure, psychosis and death . The FDA has banned the sales of dietary supplements that contain ephedra because of their significant risk to human health . However, a review of 51 websites found nearly 20% sold weight loss products that potentially violated the ban of ephedra alkaloids . | Ephedra is a stimulant herb usually from the stem and branches of Ephedra sinica. Most ephedra species contain the chemical ephedrine. It's banned in the US. The ephedrine in ephedra is responsible for its therapeutic effects and also its serious safety concerns. It stimulates the heart, lungs, and nervous system. People use ephedra for weight loss and athletic performance. It's also used for allergies, nasal congestion, asthma, common cold, headache, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Ephedra is also unsafe. Ephedra has been banned by the US FDA since April 2004. It's also banned by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), International Olympic Committee (IOC), and National Football League (NFL). Don't confuse ephedra with Mormon tea. Mormon tea comes from Ephedra nevadensis, an Ephedra species that doesn't contain ephedrine.","When taken by mouth : Ephedra is likely unsafe. Ephedra can cause severe side effects, such as high blood pressure, heart attacks, seizures, strokes, irregular heartbeat, and death. Taking ephedra with other stimulants like caffeine increases the risk of severe side effects. Do not take products that contain ephedra or its active ingredients.

These alkaloids can be used as decongestants because they constrict peripheral blood vessels, but in high doses, they also raise blood pressure (1) (2) (3). The CNS stimulation property contributes to ephedra’s appetite suppressant effects and its reputation as a weight loss agent (7). This effect, however, may lead to other cardiovascular adverse reactions such as stroke and heart attack (8). Ephedra’s antiasthmatic effect arises from its ability to relax bronchial smooth muscle. Studies indicate that ephedra also has antibacterial, anti-inflammatory and uterine stimulatory activities (9).",,"Mahuang | herbal ecstasy | Alcaloïde d'Éphédrine, Belcho, Cao Mahuang, Desert Herb, Efedra, Éphédra, Éphédra Américain, Éphédra Chinoise, Ephedra distachya, Ephedra equisetina, Éphédra Européen, Ephedra gerardiana, Ephedra intermedia, Ephedra monosperma, Ephedra shennungiana, Ephedra sinensis, Ephedra sinica, Ephedra Sinisa, Ephedra vulgaris, Ephedrae Herba, Éphèdre, Ephedrine, Éphédrine, Ephedrine Alkaloid, Épitonin, Herbal Ecstasy, Joint Fir, Ma Huang, Ma-Huang, Mahuang, Mahuanggen (ma huang root), Muzei Mahuang, Popotillo, Raisin de Mer, Sea Grape, Teamster's Tea, Thé de Désert, Yellow Astringent, Yellow Horse, Zhong Mahuang.",,Ephedra,Ephedra,Ephedra

Epimedium showed antiosteoporotic , neuroprotective , immunomodulatory , and anticancer effects , as well as anti-HIV activity in preclinical studies. Epimedium derivatives also produced radiosensitizing effects and reversed multidrug resistance in tumor cells. Small controlled studies and a systematic review suggest benefits of Epimedium for post-menopausal osteoporosis but not for relieving symptoms of Gulf War Illness . Other published trials tend to combine this herb in a botanical “recipe,” confounding the determination of any specific contributions from Epimedium or its components. Further, the safety of such phytotherapeutic compounds needs to be determined. Patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should use Epimedium with caution as it demonstrated estrogenic effects . Cancer patients may experience sexual dysfunction symptoms including painful intercourse, loss of libido, and difficulty in maintaining arousal. These problems are often multifactorial and can be caused by stress, distress, and hormonal changes, as well as treatments involving surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy. Therefore, patients should consult and be monitored by a physician to properly address individual symptoms of sexual dysfunction.",,"Icariin, a major active constituent of Epimedium, promotes estrogen biosynthesis, and enhances aromatase mRNA and protein expression as well as alkaline phosphatase activity in vitro (1). However, other studies have attributed estrogen-like activity to icariin derivatives icaritin and desmethylicaritin, rather than icariin itself (14). Icariin can also exhibit a mild phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition effect (16). It has been implicated in differentiation of stem cells into cardiomyocytes via cell cycle regulation, induction of apoptosis, modulation of reactive oxygen species generation, and the regulation of various signaling pathways (17). In undifferentiated neuronal cell lines, it exhibited neuroprotective effects through LDH leakage attenuation which reduced GSH depletion, prevented DNA oxidation damage, and inhibited caspase-3 and p53 activation; and inhibited JNK/p38 MAPK pathways (4). Icariin was also shown to reduce viability of  human esophageal cancer cells by regulating apoptotic signaling, which is mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress (23).
Icaritin, a prenylflavonoid derivative, induced sustained activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and apoptosis in both breast (9) and endometrial cancer cells (18). It also induced G2/M phase cell-cycle arrest and downregulated G2/M regulatory protein expression (9). Its radiosensitizing effects suggest ERK1/2 and AKT pathway suppression, enhanced apoptosis, and induced G2/M blockage (11). Also, icaritin may reverse doxorubicin resistance in human hepatoma cells by increasing intracellular drug accumulation, and by decreasing MDR1 and P-glycoprotein expression (12). In another study, addition of an epimedium extract to gefitinib was shown effective against drug resistance caused by T790M mutation in non-samll cell lung cancer cells (24).",,Horny Goat Weed | Yin Yang Huo | Inyokaku | Herba Epimedii,,Epimedium | Epimedium extract,Epimedium,

In fact, all parts of the plant are toxic. Hemlock is most poisonous during the early stages of growth in the spring, but it is dangerous at all stages of growth. The poisons in hemlock are so deadly that people have died after eating animals that had eaten hemlock parts. Hemlock is native to Europe and western Asia and was introduced into North America as an ornamental plant. It is frequently found in the US and southern Canada. Hemlock typically grows along streams or rivers, and near fences, roadsides, ditches, abandoned construction sites, pastures, crops, and fields. Some people have been poisoned by hemlock after confusing it for harmless plants. Accidental poisonings have occurred when people mistook the plant for parsnip, parsley, wild celery, or anise. Despite serious safety concerns, hemlock is used for bronchitis, whooping cough, asthma, arthritis, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : There isn't enough reliable information to know if eastern hemlock is safe. However, eastern hemlock contains chemicals called tannins. Therefore, it might cause side effects such as stomach problems, damage to the kidney and liver, and increased risk of cancer.

DSI005929,Feverfew,C0376266,"Feverfew is a plant that belongs to the daisy/sunflower family. It is widely used in traditional medicine for the treatment of fevers, migraine headaches, rheumatoid arthritis, stomach ache, toothache, insect bites and infertility. Although much of its activity is attributed to the compound parthenolide, a parthenolide-free extract of feverfew demonstrated free radical-scavenging properties, affording protection against UV-induced sun damage . Feverfew extracts also possess antiprotozoal , antibacterial , anti-inflammatory , and antioxidant properties. In clinical studies, a feverfew extract reduced the frequency of migraine attacks ; a formulation containing feverfew was reported useful in decreasing the duration of aura ; and a feverfew/ginger formula prevented mild headache before the onset of moderate to severe headache in patients with migraine . In another study, a combination of feverfew and acupuncture treatments led to greater improvements in quality of life in women with migraine, compared with feverfew or acupuncture alone . A systematic review found the overall evidence of efficacy for migraine to be mixed, citing the need for high-quality research . In another study, feverfew did not benefit patients with rheumatoid arthritis . In addition, parthenolide demonstrated anticancer effects in vitro . A phase I clinical study involving cancer patients showed that up to 4 mg of parthenolide was well tolerated; however, it could not be detected in the plasma . Consequently, a synthetic analog dimethylamino-parthenolide (DMAPT), a more hydrophilic form of parthenolide, with greater bioavailability was identified. Oral administration of DMAPT has been found to be safe, and resulted in increased plasma concentrations in an animal model . More studies are warranted. | Feverfew (Tanacetum parthenium) is a plant native to Asia Minor and the Balkans. Feverfew dried leaves, fresh leaves, and extracts are used in medicine. Feverfew leaves contain many different chemicals, including one called parthenolide. Parthenolide, as well as other chemicals in feverfew, might help decrease migraine headaches. People most commonly use feverfew for migraine headaches. People also use feverfew for itching, tension headache, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Dried feverfew leaf or feverfew extract is likely safe when taken for up to 4 months. Side effects might include upset stomach, heartburn, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, and vomiting. Chewing the fresh leaves of feverfew is possibly unsafe. It can cause mouth sores, swelling of the mouth, and loss of taste. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Feverfew is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. There is concern that it might cause early contractions and miscarriage. Don't use feverfew if you are pregnant. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if feverfew is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Bleeding disorders : Feverfew might slow blood clotting. Taking feverfew could increase the risk of bleeding in some people. Until more is known, use feverfew cautiously if you have a bleeding disorder. Allergy to ragweed and related plants : Feverfew might cause an allergic reaction in people who are sensitive to the Asteraceae/Compositae plant family. This includes ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many others. If you have allergies, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before taking feverfew. Surgery : Feverfew might slow blood clotting. It might cause bleeding during and after surgery. Stop taking feverfew at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","The sesquiterpene lactones, particularly parthenolide, are the active constituents responsible for feverfew’s beneficial effects. Parthenolide attenuates activation of the NF-kappa B complex to block transcription of inflammatory proteins (21). The inhibition of this pathway also leads to decreased platelet activity (22). Other mechanisms that produce antiplatelet activity by parthenolide include sulfhydryl group alterations, changes in protein kinase C interactions, and arachidonic acid metabolism (22) (23) (24). The flavonol content also has anti-inflammatory effects (25) (26).
In vitro studies suggest various activities induced by parthenolide can produce antiproliferative effects. In colorectal cancer cells, it suppresses angiogenesis by reducing VEGF and VEGF-receptor expression. (10) In cervical and breast cancer cell lines, parthenolide modulates apoptosis-regulating gene expression (11) and activates both apoptosis pathway and AMPK-autophagy survival pathway through ROS generation (12). In glioblastoma cells, it induces caspase 3/7-mediated apoptosis independent of NF-kappa B suppression (27). Parthenolide sensitizes the tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) leading to apoptosis via activation of both caspases 8 and 3 in hepatocellular carcinoma cells (17).",,"Featherfew | Santa Maria | wild chamomile | wild quinine | Altamisa, Bachelor's Buttons, Chrysanthème Matricaire, Chrysanthemum parthenium, Chrysanthemum praealtum, Featerfoiul, Featherfew, Featherfoil, Flirtwort Midsummer Daisy, Grande Camomille, Leucanthemum parthenium, Matricaria, Matricaria eximia, Matricaria parthenium, Partenelle, Pyrèthre Doré, Pyrèthre Mousse, Pyrethrum parthenium, Santa Maria, Tanaceti Parthenii, Tanacetum Parthenium, Tanaisie Commune.",,Feverfew,Feverfew,Feverfew

It has been used for centuries in Ayurvedic medicine to treat a variety of conditions including heart disease, respiratory disorders, and hypothyroidism. However, studies are quite limited and only a few actually use forskolin as an oral supplement. Laboratory studies suggest it has inotropic and antiplatelet properties . In animal models, forskolin promoted activation of adenylate cyclase and increased intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate . Treatment of uropathogenic E.coli-infected mice with forskolin reduced bacteria . Small clinical studies suggest that forskolin may help weight management or reduce asthma attacks . When administered intravenously or inhaled, forskolin had a bronchodilation effect . Preliminary findings also suggest intraoperative infusion of forskolin may benefit cardiovascular health due to anti-inflammatory effects or that intraarterial forskolin daropate may improve cerebral vasospasm in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage . Forskolin and its derivatives showed anticancer effects . When applied on the skin of mice, forskolin stimulated production of melanin in the absence of ultraviolet light . It has been proposed for use in sunless tanning lotions to reduce skin cancer risk by decreasing sun exposure. A forskolin extract reduced viral production in human lymphoid CEM-GFP cells infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1NL4) . However, these effects have yet to be confirmed in clinical studies.",,"Forskolin activates adenylate cyclase through direct stimulation and modulation of enzyme activities, leading to increased intracellular concentrations of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) (1). This may explain bronchodilation (4) (5) (6), inotropic (7), vasodilatory (16), and antiplatelet (11) effects. Forskolin also increased cellular acetylcholinesterase and protected neuronal cells from organophosphate toxicity (17).
Preclinical studies suggest forskolin and derivatives may inhibit cell proliferation, and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells (18) (19).

It has a long history of use in the traditional Chinese and Ayurvedic medicine systems. Gotu kola contains certain chemicals that seem to decrease swelling and blood pressure. It also seems to increase collagen production, which might be helpful for wound healing. People use gotu kola for burns and poor circulation that can lead to varicose veins. It is also used for scars, stretch marks, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.",When taken by mouth : Gotu kola extract is possibly safe for most people when taken for up to 12 months. It might cause nausea and stomach pain. When applied to the skin : Gotu kola is possibly safe when used for up to 10 weeks. It might cause itchiness and redness. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Gotu kola is possibly safe when applied to the skin during pregnancy. There isn't enough reliable information to know if gotu kola is safe to take by mouth when pregnant. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if gotu kola is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Liver disease : Gotu kola might cause liver damage. People who already have a liver disease should avoid using gotu kola. It might make liver problems worse. Surgery : Gotu kola might cause too much sleepiness if combined with medications used during and after surgery. Stop using gotu kola at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.,"Triterpenoids have been identified as active constituents. Asiaticoside demonstrates anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting lipopolysaccharide-induced fever and inflammatory response, including production of serum TNF-alpha, IL-6, PGE2, liver myeloperoxidase activity, and expression of brain COX-2 protein (23). Asiaticoside also promotes wound healing by stimulating collagen and glycosaminoglycan synthesis and angiogenesis (6). Another study showed that a gotu kola extract may regulate stress-induced premature senescence by preventing repression of DNA replication and mitosis-related gene expression (24).

DSI006060,Goldenseal,C0330270,"Derived from the root of the plant, goldenseal is a North American botanical with origins as a traditional remedy among Native Americans. It has historically been used for skin and eye irritations, as a bitter tonic, and to improve digestive function. Purported properties have led to its use for a variety of ailments including the common cold, fever, infections, constipation, and muscle spasms. Goldenseal is also marketed as an antioxidant and is often combined with echinacea in supplements to support immune function. Studies on goldenseal and its compounds are limited. The primary active constituents are hydrastine and berberine. Among several herbs tested in vitro, goldenseal extract was the most active growth inhibitor of H. pylori . Studies of berberine suggest that it has antimicrobial , cytotoxic, and apoptotic effects . Other animal studies have suggested potential liver toxicity with goldenseal root, but this occurred at very high doses over long-term ingestion . Laboratory studies demonstrating phototoxicity suggest this would be more likely from topical rather than supplement use . Clinical studies are lacking and would be needed to determine safety and efficacy. | Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis) is an herb in the buttercup family. The dried root is very commonly used in supplements in the US. Goldenseal contains berberine, which might have effects against bacteria and fungi. Berberine also has properties that can lower blood pressure and help irregular heartbeat. But many of the important chemicals in goldenseal aren't absorbed well when taken by mouth. So, it's not clear if goldenseal has the same effects as berberine. People use goldenseal for the common cold and other upper respiratory tract infections, hay fever, diarrhea, constipation, and many other conditions. But there is no good scientific evidence to support any of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Goldenseal is possibly safe for most adults when taken as a single dose. There isn't enough reliable information to know if goldenseal is safe to use as more than a single dose. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Using goldenseal during pregnancy or breast-feeding is likely unsafe for the infant. A hazardous chemical in goldenseal can cross the placenta and can also find its way into breast milk. Brain damage has developed in newborn infants exposed to goldenseal. Do not use goldenseal during pregnancy or breast-feeding. Children : Don't use goldenseal in newborn babies. It is likely unsafe for them. It might cause brain damage. Bleeding conditions : Use goldenseal with caution. Taking goldenseal might increase the risk of bleeding in individuals with bleeding disorders. High bilirubin levels in the blood in infants : Bilirubin is a chemical that is produced when the old red blood cells break down. Berberine, a chemical in goldenseal, may keep the liver from removing bilirubin fast enough. This can cause brain problems, especially in infants with high levels of bilirubin in the blood. Avoid using. Surgery : Goldenseal might increase the risk for bleeding. People who take goldenseal should stop at least 2 weeks before surgery.","The active characteristics of goldenseal are attributed to the compounds hydrastine and berberine, in which most laboratory studies have been conducted. In human prostate and breast cancer cells, berberine induced cell cycle arrest (2) (4). At the same time, tumorigenicity in rodents from long-term high-dose ingestion of goldenseal root powder is partly attributed to the topoisomerase inhibition properties of berberine or its metabolite (26), although the comparative doses are unlikely in humans. Still, DNA damage in liver cells via topoisomerase inhibition was attributed to berberine in goldenseal and was also observed with commercial goldenseal products, with the extent of DNA damage positively correlating with berberine content (27).",,"Goldenroot | Eye root | Turmeric root | Yellow paint root | Chinese Goldenseal, Eye Balm, Eye Root, Fard Inolien, Framboise de Terre, Goldenroot, Goldsiegel, Ground Raspberry, Hydraste, Hydraste du Canada, Hydrastis canadensis, Indian Dye, Indian Plant, Indian Turmeric, Jaundice Root, Orange Root, Racine à la Jaunisse, Racine Orange, Sceau D'Or, Sello de Oro, Turmeric Root, Warnera, Wild Curcuma, Yellow Indian Paint, Yellow Paint, Yellow Puccoon, Yellow Root.",,Goldenseal,Goldenseal,Goldenseal

Preclinical studies suggest that the compound guggulsterone has antiangiogenic and antitumor properties . In an animal study, guggul had cardioprotective effects . Studies in humans are limited, but suggest guggul may be effective for hypercholesterolemia . However, other trials indicate uncertain benefit or that guggul may actually raise cholesterol levels .

Additional research is needed to determine safety and efficacy. | Guggul is made from the oily sap (gum resin) of the guggul tree (Commiphora wightii). The guggul tree grows in India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. Guggul contains plant steroids that might affect cholesterol levels in the body. One of these substances might also reduce redness and swelling from acne. People use guggul for acne, obesity, high cholesterol, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using guggul for COVID-19. Don't confuse guggul with Boswellia serrata or myrrh. These are not the same.","When taken by mouth : Guggul is possibly safe when used for up to 24 weeks. It's usually well-tolerated, but some people may experience a bitter taste when ingested. Side effects might include stomach upset and headache. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if guggul is safe or what the side effects might be. Some people might develop an allergic rash. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Guggul is likely unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. It might stimulate the uterus and cause a miscarriage. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if guggul is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Bleeding disorders : Guggul can slow blood clotting. This might cause bleeding or bruising in people with bleeding disorders. Hormone-sensitive condition such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Guggul might act like estrogen in the body. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, do not use guggul. Surgery : Guggul might increase the risk of bleeding during and after surgery. Stop using guggul at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery. Underactive or overactive thyroid (hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism) : Guggul might interfere with treatment for these conditions. If you have a thyroid condition, speak with a healthcare provider before use.","In vitro, guggulsterone affected biosynthesis of cholesterol in the liver (2). Cholesterol-lowering activity in mice was attributed to inhibition of FXR, a nuclear hormone receptor that is activated by bile acids. FXR mediates a negative feedback loop to decrease bile acid production by the liver. This loop is an important component of cholesterol metabolism regulation (10). In humans, hypolipidemic outcomes may be better for those with a higher capacity to metabolize Z-guggulsterone with moderate carboxylesterase induction (19).
In tumor cells, guggulsterone induced apoptosis by activating JNK (5) and repressing Akt signaling (6).
Guggulsterone activates nuclear receptors such as estrogen receptor alpha, pregnane X receptor, and progesterone receptor and may induce CYP3A genes (8).",,"Gum guggal | Gum guggulu | Guggal | Balsamodendrum wightii, Balsamodendrum mukul, Commiphora mukul, Commiphora wightii, Devadhupa, Gomme Guggul, Gomme-Résine de Guggul, Guggal, Guggul Gum Resin, Guggul Lipids, Guggulipid, Guggulipide, Guggulu, Guggulu Suddha, Guggulsterone, Guggulstérone, Guggulsterones, Guggulstérones, Guglipid, Gugulipid, Gum Guggal, Gum Guggulu, Indian Bdellium, Indian Bdellium-Tree, Koushika, Mukul Myrrh Tree, Palankasha, Yogaraj Guggul Gum Resin.",,Guggul,Guggul,Guggul

The status of a 2011 phase II clinical trial of germanium to reduce radiation-induced fatigue in cancer patients is unknown and has not produced any results . There are concerns of contamination of germanium products by the toxic inorganic germanium dioxide. The FDA has issued warning letters to marketers of germanium about unsubstantiated claims.

Be careful not to confuse golden ragwort (Senecio aureus) with other species of ragwort, such as alpine ragwort and tansy ragwort. Despite serious safety concerns, people take golden ragwort to treat diabetes, high blood pressure, water retention, bleeding, chest congestion, and spasms. Women use golden ragwort for treating irregular or painful menstrual periods and symptoms of menopause. They also use it to reduce pain and ease childbirth. Some people put golden ragwort on the gums to stop bleeding after removal of a tooth.","There’s a lot of concern about using golden ragwort as medicine, because it contains chemicals called hepatotoxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs), which may block blood flow in the veins and cause liver damage. Hepatotoxic PAs might also cause cancer and birth defects. Golden ragwort preparations that are not certified and labeled “hepatotoxic PA-free” are considered UNSAFE . It’s also UNSAFE to apply golden ragwort to broken skin. The dangerous chemicals in golden ragwort can be absorbed quickly through broken skin and can lead to dangerous body-wide toxicity. Steer clear of skin products that aren’t certified and labeled “hepatotoxic PA-free.” There isn’t enough information to know if it’s safe to apply golden ragwort to unbroken skin. It’s best to avoid use. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : It’s UNSAFE to use golden ragwort preparations that might contain hepatotoxic PAs during pregnancy. These products might cause birth defects and liver damage. It’s also UNSAFE to use golden ragwort preparations that might contain hepatotoxic PAs if you are breast-feeding. These chemicals can pass into breast-milk and might harm the nursing infant. It’s not known whether products that are certified hepatotoxic PA-free are safe to use during pregnancy or breast-feeding. Stay in the safe side and avoid using any golden ragwort preparation if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Allergy to ragweed and related plants : Golden ragwort may cause an allergic reaction in people who are allergic to the Asteraceae/Compositae plant family. Members of this family include ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many others. If you have allergies, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before taking golden ragwort.

Hops is also used as an herbal medicine for mood disturbance and insomnia and to treat menopausal symptoms. In vitro studies suggest hops has antibacterial , chemopreventive , antitumor , antiangiogenic , anti-inflammatory , phytoestrogenic , and antidiabetic properties. In murine models, hops reduced hyperlipidemia and obesity , and protected against bone loss following estrogen depletion . In clinical studies, a hops-valerian combination product was reported to improve sleep quality and insulin sensitivity in patients with type-2 diabetes . Other preliminary studies suggest hops extracts may alleviate mild depression, anxiety, and stress or decrease body fat in healthy subjects . Data from an observational study suggest a combination of hops, rosemary extract, and oleanolic acid may help reduce arthritic pain . However, it is not clear whether hops alone would exert similar effects. In postmenopausal women, a few studies suggest hops extracts may alleviate menopausal symptoms and improve bone health . Some studies also indicate that derivates of hops have phytoestrogenic effects . Patients with hormone-sensitive cancers should consult their physicians before using products containing hops. | Hops are the dried, flowering parts of the hop plant (Humulus lupulus), commonly used in brewing beer. They have limited evidence of health benefits. The term ""hops"" comes from the Anglo-Saxon term ""hoppan"", which means ""to climb."" Hops contain many chemicals, including bitter acids, which contribute to its bitter flavor. Some chemicals in hops seem to act similarly to the hormone estrogen and some seem to cause sleepiness. People commonly use hops for anxiety, sleep disorders, restlessness, symptoms of menopause, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth :

Hops are commonly consumed in foods. Hops extracts and hops bitter acids are possibly safe when used short-term. Hops extracts have been used safely in doses of up to 300 mg daily for up to 3 months. Hops bitter acids have been used safely in doses of 35 mg daily for 3 months. Hops might cause dizziness and sleepiness in some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if hops are safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Hormone sensitive cancers and conditions : Some chemicals in hops act like the hormone estrogen. People who have conditions that are sensitive to estrogen should use caution when taking hops. Some of these conditions include breast cancer and endometriosis. Surgery : Hops might cause too much sleepiness when combined with anesthesia and other medications during and after surgical procedures. Stop taking hops at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Animal models suggest isomerized hops extracts may increase plasma HDL levels and decrease atherosclerosis index via PPAR-alpha activation (14). These extracts also reduced plasma triglycerides and induced hepatomegaly (8). A product containing hops extract reduced C-reactive protein in patients with inflammatory diseases (12).
Prenyl flavonoids from hops, xanthohumol, isoxanthohumol, and 8-prenylnaringen (8-PN) inhibit aromatase activity and breast cancer cell proliferation, increase apoptosis (5), and inhibit prostate cancer cell proliferation (3). 8-PN is among the potent estrogen receptor alpha phytoestrogens, which is likely responsible for relief of menopausal symptoms (29). In addition, xanthohumol exhibits antiangiogenic effects by inhibiting the NF-kB and Akt pathways (6). Isoadhumulone, isocohumulone, and isohumulone derived from hops selectively inhibited aldo-keto-reductase 1B10, which is upregulated in various cancers promoting carcinogenesis (30).
Isoxanthohumols are converted in the distal human gut into 8-PN via intestinal microflora activity (12). This process also occurs in the liver and is regulated by CYP450 enzymes (15).",Female inflorescences of Humulus lupulus L.,"

The seed extract is used as a dietary supplement to support vascular function. Horse chestnut should not be confused with sweet chestnut. Lab studies suggest that aescin, or escin, in horse chestnut has anti-inflammatory , neuroprotective , and antitumor effects, and may enhance gemcitabine efficacy . Data from earlier trials suggest horse chestnut seed extract has efficacy against chronic venous insufficiency and is safe and well tolerated , but a Cochrane review of rutosides did not find any clear evidence of benefit for post-thrombotic syndrome . Other studies suggest aescin may improve sperm quality in patients with varicocele-associated infertility . Patients with compromised renal or hepatic function should not consume horse chestnut products. | Horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) is a tree. Horse chestnut contains significant amounts of a poison called esculin and can cause death if eaten raw. Horse chestnut also contains a substance that thins the blood. It makes it harder for fluid to leak out of veins and capillaries, which can help prevent water retention (edema). The horse chestnut fruits contain seeds that look like the sweet chestnut but have a bitter taste. People most commonly take horse chestnut seed extracts by mouth to treat poor circulation that can cause the legs to swell (chronic venous insufficiency or CVI). It's also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these other uses. Be careful not to confuse Aesculus hippocastanum (Horse chestnut) with Aesculus californica (California buckeye) or Aesculus glabra (Ohio buckeye). Some people call any of these plants horse chestnut, but they are different plants with different effects.","When taken by mouth : Standardized horse chestnut seed extract products are likely safe for most people when used short-term. Only use products which have had esculin, a toxic substance, removed. Horse chestnut products can sometimes cause side effects such as dizziness, headache, stomach upset, and itching. Raw horse chestnut seed, bark, flower, and leaf contain esculin and are unsafe to use. Signs of esculin poisoning include stomach upset, muscle twitching, weakness, vomiting, diarrhea, depression, and paralysis. Seek immediate medical attention if you've accidentally consumed raw horse chestnut. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if horse chestnut is safe. Some people are allergic to horse chestnut. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Taking the raw seed, bark, flower, or leaf is unsafe and can lead to death. There isn't enough reliable information to know if horse chestnut seed extract products are safe during pregnancy and breast-feeding, even if they have had the poisonous chemical esculin removed. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : The raw horse chestnut seed, bark, flower, and leaf are unsafe and can even cause death. Children have been poisoned by drinking a tea made from the leaves and twigs, or from eating the seeds. Bleeding disorders : Horse chestnut might slow blood clotting. Taking horse chestnut might increase the risk of bruising and bleeding in people with bleeding disorders. Digestion problems : Horse chestnut seeds and bark can irritate the stomach. Don't use it if you have a bowel or stomach disorder. Liver disease : There is one report of liver injury associated with using horse chestnut. If you have a liver condition, it is best to avoid horse chestnut. Latex allergy : People who are allergic to latex might also be allergic to horse chestnut. Kidney disease : There is a concern that horse chestnut might make kidney disease worse. Do not use it if you have kidney problems. Surgery : Horse chestnut might slow blood clotting. Horse chestnut might increase the risk of bleeding if used before surgery. People using horse chestnut should stop at least 2 weeks before surgery.","Aescin, a natural mixture of triterpenoid saponins isolated from the seed of horse chestnut, has been identified as the active principle. Its anti-inflammatory effects involve downregulation of inflammatory gene expression and upregulation granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor production, which also confers neuroprotection (1).
Aescin may reduce chronic venous insufficiency via inhibition of elastase and hyaluronidase, both involved in enzymatic proteoglycan degradation, which constitutes part of the capillary endothelium and is the main component of the extravascular matrix (19). Contraction of veins and arteries with horse chestnut may be partially mediated through 5-HT(2A) receptors (20). It also reduced platelet aggregation in vitro (20).
Beta-aescin and 5-fluorouracil inhibited human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, perhaps via synergistic effects including cell-cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis, caspase-3, -8 and -9 activation, and Bcl-2 downregulation (17). Escin potentiated gemcitabine efficacy in part through NF-κB inhibition and consequent inhibition of c-Myc, COX-2, cyclin D1, survivin, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL, and caspase-3 activation (18).",,"Chestnut | Marron europeen | Escine | Escin | Aescin | Aescin, Aescine, Aesculus hippocastanum, Buckeye, Castaño de Indias, Châtaignier de Mer, Châtaignier des Chevaux, Chestnut, Conker Tree, Escine, Faux-Châtaignier, Hippocastani Cortex, Hippocastani Flos, Hippocastani Folium, Hippocastani Semen, Hippocastanum Vulgare Gaertn, Marron Europeen, Marronnier, Marronnier Blanc, Marronnier Commun, Marronnier d'Inde, Marronnier des Chevaux, Pu, Sodium Aescinate, Spanish Chestnut, Venastat, Venostasin Retard, Venostat, White Chestnut.",,Horse Chestnut | Red Horse Chestnut,Horse Chestnut,Horse Chestnut

A compound isolated from Hoodia was shown to reduce food intake in rats . However, consumption of a hoodia extract did not affect body weight in healthy overweight women . Currently, supplements containing Hoodia are being promoted for weight loss and some cancer patients use these for weight control. Patients should use caution as hoodia can interact with certain prescription drugs. The FDA has warned the manufacturer and distributors of a Hoodia product against making unsubstantiated and misleading claims about weight loss . | Hoodia is a cactus-type plant from the Kalahari Desert in Africa. People use hoodia to curb their appetite so they can lose weight. According to some claims, San bushmen in Africa eat hoodia to fight off hunger during long hunts. Be careful when buying hoodia products. According to news reports, some samples of hoodia sold on the Internet do not contain any hoodia at all. You might not get what's listed on the label. Also, a certain hoodia product (P57 Hoodia, Huikng Pharmaceuticals) has been shown to contain sibutramine. Sibutramine is a substance removed from the US market in 2010 due to its potential to increase blood pressure and heart rate.","There isn't enough information to know if hoodia is safe. There is some evidence that hoodia might cause minor side effects such as headache, dizziness, giddiness, nausea, and unusual skin sensations. Also, there is concern that hoodia might increase blood pressure and heart rate.

Diabetes : Hoodia might lower blood sugar by increasing the production of insulin. Watch for signs of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) and monitor your blood sugar carefully if you are being treated for diabetes and use hoodia. High blood pressure : Hoodia might increase blood pressure. This might cause blood pressure to become too high in people already at risk for high blood pressure.","Hoodia extracts are thought to have an appetite suppressant effect, but it is not clear what causes such an effect. In an experiment done in rats, intracerebroventricular administration of P57 resulted in an increase in ATP level in hypothalamic neurons. It is hypothesized that neurons in the basal hypothalamus may be sensitive to changes in ATP levels and regulate food intake (1). P57 also inhibited CYP 3A4 activity (5) (6).

The leaves have been used in traditional medicine to treat pain, fatigue, fever, diarrhea, and wounds , while its extracts are known for their psychoactive properties, especially morphine-like effects . Kratom has gained popularity as a supplement to improve mood, and decrease anxiety and pain. It has also been a source of significant controversy. The FDA has issued numerous statements against kratom, citing adverse events, potentially related deaths, risk of addiction or overdose, and incidences of contaminated supplements . Kratom has both stimulant and sedative properties . The main psychoactive constituents are mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine . In vivo studies of derivative compounds and analogs from kratom demonstrate antinociceptive effects . Animal models suggest that kratom has muscle relaxant , anti-inflammatory , analgesic , and anorectic properties. Mitragynine has also shown antioxidant and antiproliferative effects in a few cancer cell lines . Data on the use and safety of kratom in humans are very limited. Stimulant effects occur at lower doses, while sedative and pain-relieving effects occur at higher doses . Kratom users may develop physiological dependence and experience withdrawal , but this risk has not yet been adequately quantified . More research on the therapeutic uses for kratom and its constituents, as well as its toxic effects and abuse potential is needed. The biological activities of kratom in humans are still poorly characterized . Because of its potential interactions with other drugs and possible side effects , kratom should not be used as a substitute for prescription pain medications. Several countries and US states have banned the use of kratom due to its potential for abuse . | Kratom (Mitragyna speciosa) is a tree native to Southeast Asia. The leaves contain a chemical called mitragynine, which works like opioids such as morphine. Kratom has pain-relieving effects like opioid drugs. It also has many of the same serious safety concerns as other opioids. People commonly use kratom for withdrawal from heroin, morphine, and other opioid drugs, as well as cough, depression, anxiety, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Using kratom can also be unsafe. Kratom is banned in some states and countries due to serious safety concerns. The US FDA has warned consumers to avoid using products containing kratom.","When taken by mouth : Kratom is possibly unsafe for most people. Large doses of kratom can cause many serious side effects, including nausea, aggression, hallucinations, trouble breathing, and death. Long-term use has been linked with dependence and withdrawal symptoms similar to other opioids. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if kratom is safe or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Kratom is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. Babies exposed to kratom during pregnancy have experienced withdrawal symptoms after birth. These babies required special treatment for addiction. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if kratom is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Alcohol use disorder : People with alcohol dependence who use kratom appear to have an increased risk of suicide. Epilepsy : People with epilepsy who use kratom might have an increased risk of seizures. Heart conditions : Kratom might worsen existing heart conditions. It might increase the risk of a very fast heartbeat. Mental disorders : Kratom might worsen existing mental disorders. People with mental disorders who use kratom appear to have an increased risk of suicide.","The main active alkaloids in kratom are mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, which is thought to have analgesic effects comparable to morphine (11) (23). Through monoaminergic and opioid receptors, both compounds produce a range of CNS stimulant and depressant effects (23) (24) (25).
Although structurally different (26), mitragynine administration causes cognitive impairment and addiction profiles that closely resemble those of morphine (27). Other research also suggests these compounds share classic opioid characteristics — affinity for opioid receptors, analgesic cross-tolerance, and competitive interaction with naloxone — while possessing other novel attributes (28).
In animal models, anxiolytic-like effects are attributed to opioidergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic interactions in brain regions (29).

DSI006361,Kava kava,C0939882,"Derived from the rhizome of the plant, kava is from the Pacific Rim and Hawaiian Islands. It is used as a social beverage in those areas and to relieve anxiety, stress, and insomnia. Kavalactones in kava are thought to be the active constituent that produces skeletal muscle relaxation, non-narcotic anesthesia, and local anesthetic effects. Clinical data suggest moderate benefits with kava as short-term use for generalized anxiety disorder , and no differences in withdrawal or addiction versus placebo . Several other studies also support the use of kava for relieving anxiety , but a recent double-blind placebo-controlled trial did not find benefit . Although it has been suggested as an alternative to benzodiazepines, an internet-based study suggests that kava is not superior to placebo in reducing anxiety , and a randomized clinical trial reported similar findings . While a systematic review showed that kava does not have negative effects on cognition , there have been case reports of impairment consistent with CNS depressant effects, including slow, slurred speech and flaccid muscle tone . In addition, due to concerns of hepatotoxicity, the Canadian, French, and British governments withdrew availability of kava and kava-containing products . The Food and Drug Administration has advised consumers about the potential risks of liver injury associated with kava consumption. However, following a World Health Organization recommendation to study aqueous extracts of kava, initial research results support the benefits of kava . Case analyses of 14 patients with hepatic injury resulting from kava use revealed low-quality products, overdose, prolonged use and co-medication as causative factors . Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings. Kava consumption has been associated with low cancer incidence , but one of its constituents was shown to stimulate growth of melanoma cells . | Kava is a beverage or extract made from the Piper methysticum plant. In the South Pacific, it's a popular drink that is used in ceremonies for relaxation. The name ""kava"" comes from the Polynesian word ""awa,"" which means bitter. Kava affects the brain and other parts of the central nervous system. Chemicals called kavalactones that are found in kava are believed to be responsible for its effects. People commonly use kava for anxiety. It's also used for stress, withdrawal from drugs called benzodiazepines, sleeping problems, and many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses. Cases of liver damage and even some deaths have been linked to kava use. Because of this, kava was taken off the market in Europe and Canada in the early 2000s. But after reviewing the evidence, most countries have allowed kava to return to the market. Kava was never taken off the market in the US.","When taken by mouth : Kava is possibly safe when taken for up to 6 months. Using kava can make it difficult to drive or operate machinery safely. Do not take kava before you plan on driving. ""Driving-under-the-influence"" citations have been issued to people driving erratically after drinking large amounts of kava tea. People might have heard that using kava can cause liver damage. This seems to be rare and is most often linked to long-term use of very high doses. Most people who have used kava haven't experienced liver toxicity. Also, past cases of liver toxicity might not be due to kava. Other factors may have contributed to these toxic effects. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Kava is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth while pregnant or breast-feeding. It might affect the uterus while pregnant. Also, some of the chemicals in kava can pass into breast milk and might hurt a breast-fed infant. Avoid using it. Liver disease : People who have liver problems should avoid kava. It might make liver disease worse. Parkinson disease : People who have Parkinson disease should avoid kava. It might make this condition worse. Surgery : Kava affects the central nervous system. It might increase the effects of anesthesia and other medications used during and after surgery. Stop using kava at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","Kavapyrones are centrally-acting skeletal muscle relaxants, anticonvulsants, and peripherally-acting local anesthetics. There are conflicting data on the effects of kavapyrones on CNS levels of dopamine and serotonin (14). Possible hepatotoxicity mechanisms are thought to be CYP450 inhibition, reduction in liver glutathione content, or inhibition of COX activity (4) (15).
In vitro and in vivo studies suggest that kavapyrone- and pipermethystine-containing extracts induce mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and apoptosis of Hep2G cells (16) (17). The major constituent kavain was found to potentiate GABAA receptors (38).

Be careful not to confuse Mormon tea (Ephedra nevadensis) with ephedra (Ephedra sinica and other ephedra species). Unlike these other plants, Mormon tea does not contain ephedrine, an unsafe stimulant. As a medicine, people use Mormon tea for sexually transmitted diseases, colds, kidney disorders, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. | Oolong tea is made from the Camellia sinensis plant. Its dried leaves and leaf buds are used to make several different teas, including black and green teas. Oolong tea is fermented for longer than green tea, but less than black tea. It contains caffeine which affects thinking and alertness. Caffeine works by stimulating the central nervous system, heart, and muscles. People use oolong tea for mental alertness. It is also used for obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, autism, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these other uses. Don't confuse oolong tea with other caffeine sources, including coffee, black tea, and green tea. These are not the same. | Oswego tea is made from an herb called Monarda didyma. It has a smell similar to bergamot and has sometimes been used as medicine. People use Oswego tea for flatulence, premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support its use for any purpose. Oswego tea is sometimes called bee balm. Lemon balm is also called bee balm, but these are not the same. | Pu-erh tea is made by parching and then fermenting the leaves of Camellia sinsensis, the same plant that is used for making green, oolong, and black teas. Pu-erh tea is mainly made in southwestern China and Taiwan. It contains caffeine, which stimulates the central nervous system, heart, and muscles. Pu-erh tea also contains antioxidants that might help protect the heart and blood vessels.

The bark and berries contain betasitosterol, which can prevent cholesterol absorption in the gastrointestinal tract (7). The hepatoprotective effects of lycium polysaccharides (LBP) are in part via modulation of transcription factor NF-κB and MAPK pathways and autophagy (6). In another study, LBP antioxidant effects against insulin resistance were attributed to PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 pathway activation (24). It also exerted protective effects against focal cerebral ischemic injury by attenuating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (25). In murine models of acute pancreatitis, LBP reduced inflammation by upregulating NRF2 and HO-1 (30). Protective effects against diabetic peripheral neuropathy is thought to be mediated via autophagy induction (31).
LBP inhibited the growth of leukemia HL-60 cells (2) and increased expression of IL-2 and TNF-alpha (3). Antiproliferative effects may occur via activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (20).

DSI006563,Milk Thistle,C0872906,"Derived from the seed, pod, or fruit of milk thistle, the flavolignan silymarin is used primarily to manage various liver diseases. Preclinical studies suggest flavonoids in milk thistle have antioxidant and anticancer effects , and may protect against Alzheimer’s disease . Supplementation with milk thistle or silymarin improved lipid profiles and glycemic indices in type 2 diabetic patients and biomarkers related to obesity and its comorbidities . It may also be useful against alcoholic liver disease , cirrhosis , for improving fibrosis associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis , and for reducing risk of anti tuberculosis drug-induced liver injury . However, in both a large survey and a subsequent multi-center trial of patients with chronic hepatitis C, silymarin did not significantly reduce serum ALT levels , and despite its association with reduced progression from fibrosis to cirrhosis, had no impact on clinical outcomes . Milk thistle was also reported ineffective against trichotillomania but topical use may accelerate wound healing following episiotomy and improve severity of acne . Small studies suggest benefits of milk thistle in reducing chemo-induced hepatotoxicity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and in non-metastatic breast cancer patients ; and radiation therapy-induced mucositis in those with head and neck cancer . Topical use of a silymarin gel decreased the severity of capecitabine-induced hand-foot syndrome in GI cancer patients and radiodermatitis in patients with breast cancer . Both silymarin and silibinin have estrogenic effects with greater affinity for estrogen receptor (ER-beta), and activation of ER-beta results in suppression of cell growth. Silibinin can also exacerbate the negative effects of chronic alcohol consumption on liver cancer . | Milk thistle (Silybum marianum) is a plant native to Europe that was brought to North America by early colonists. It seems to help lower blood sugar. Milk thistle is now found throughout the eastern United States, California, South America, Africa, Australia, and Asia. Its seed might protect liver cells from toxic chemicals and drugs. It also seems to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. People commonly take milk thistle by mouth for diabetes. It is also commonly used for liver disorders, including liver damage caused by alcohol, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cirrhosis of the liver, chronic hepatitis, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses. Don't confuse milk thistle with blessed thistle (Cnicus benedictus).","When taken by mouth : Milk thistle extract is likely safe for most people. While most people tolerate milk thistle well, it can cause some mild side effects including bloating, indigestion, diarrhea, nausea, and gas. When applied to the skin : Milk thistle extract is possibly safe when used for short periods of time. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if milk thistle is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Milk thistle is possibly safe when taken by mouth for up to 9 months in children 1 year of age and older. Allergy to ragweed and related plants : Milk thistle might cause an allergic reaction in people who are sensitive to the Asteraceae/Compositae plant family. This includes ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, daisies, and many others. If you have allergies, be sure to check with your healthcare provider before taking milk thistle. Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Milk thistle extracts might act like estrogen. If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use these extracts.","Animal models suggest that silymarin confers hepatoprotection via downregulation of extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen (2). It may also be useful against liver carcinogenesis by inhibiting mast cells, a source of matrix metalloproteins that are involved in invasion and angiogenesis (29). In addition, silymarin reduced cisplatin-induced kidney damage in rats without diminishing the drug’s antitumor activity (7), and suppressed formation of amyloid beta-proteins and neurotoxicity in mice (30).
Silibinin, one of the flavonoids, demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting release of hydrogen peroxide and production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (31). Another study showed improvement in endothelial dysfunction via reduction in circulating and vascular asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels. ADMA is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and is believed to play a role in endothelial dysfunction, associated with cardiovascular disease (32). Silibinin also inhibits the early phase of hepatitis C viral infection by affecting endosomal trafficking of virions (34).
Other studies indicate milk thistle flavonoids exert anticancer effects by arresting G1 and S phases of the cell cycle (8). Silybin inhibited hepatocellular carcinoma cell growth via the Notch signaling pathway (36). Silibinin suppressed the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-induced expression of CD44, the transmembrane receptor for hyaluronan implicated in tumor cell invasion and metastasis by inhibiting EGFR activity in breast cancer cells (33). Suggested mechanisms for reduced efficacy of silibinin in liver tumor-bearing animals that were co-administered ethanol include impaired hepatic processing of silibinin (10).
Silybin and isosilybin were shown to strongly inhibit PXR-mediated CYP3A4 induction (35).",,"Holy thistle | Lady's thistle | Mary thistle | Marian thistle | Artichaut Sauvage, Blessed Milk Thistle, Cardo Lechoso, Cardui Mariae Fructus, Cardui Mariae Herba, Carduus Marianum, Carduus marianus, Chardon Argenté, Chardon de Marie, Chardon de Notre-Dame, Chardon Marbré, Chardon-Marie, Épine Blanche, Holy Thistle, Lady's Thistle, Lait de Notre-Dame, Legalon, Marian Thistle, Mariendistel, Mary Thistle, Our Lady's Thistle, Shui Fei Ji, Silibinin, Silybe de Marie, Silybin, Silybum, Silybum marianum, Silymarin, Silymarine, St. Mary Thistle, St. Marys Thistle.",,Milk Thistle,Milk Thistle,Milk Thistle

DSI006641,Mate,,"Mate is a plant native to South America. It is widely consumed as a hot beverage known as chimarrão, and is also used in traditional medicine. Mate is valued for its stimulatory effects and promoted as a dietary supplement for weight loss, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer prevention. In vitro studies indicate that mate has antioxidant and cardioprotective properties . Animal models also suggest antiadipogenic and antilipidemic effects . Studies in humans are limited. One product containing mate delayed gastric emptying in overweight patients , and other data in generally healthy women suggest consumption may have short-term effects on caloric intake and appetite regulation . However, higher bodyweight has been observed in a large population of heavy mate drinkers . Studies on mate for bone health are also mixed . In various cancer models, mate compounds exhibited proteasome and topoisomerase inhibitory properties, as well as anti-inflammatory and apoptotic effects . However, no large-scale clinical studies have evaluated safety and efficacy of mate in humans. Further, epidemiologic data show that chronic mate drinkers are at an increased risk of prostate , bladder , esophageal , lung , and head and neck cancers . This risk appears to be additive when combined with chronic alcohol or tobacco use . Evidence also suggests that drinking very hot mate contributes to its carcinogenic effects , although consuming large amounts can increase risk regardless of temperature .",,"In vitro studies suggest antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of mate may be due to its polyphenolic content (1) (22) (26), while cardioprotective effects occur through the regulation of nitric oxide (2). Caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine are the xanthines in mate largely responsible for its stimulatory effects (21) (22) (23) (24) (25).
In animal models, mate regulates adipogenesis through the Wnt pathway (3), reduces lipid peroxidation, improves endothelial function and LPL and HL activities, and modulates lipogenic gene expression (4). Thermogenic properties are related to enhanced expression of uncoupling proteins, while increased fatty acid oxidation is linked to AMPK phosphorylation in visceral adipose tissue (27).
Anticancer activities of mate extract may occur through proteasome (8) and topoisomerase (9) inhibition. It also reduced DNA damage from oxidative stress (1). In human colon cancer cells, saponins and phenolics in mate demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity and induced apoptosis through caspase activation (10) (11). However, other carcinogenic constituents in mate and high temperatures used for brewing could facilitate their solubility and absorption (19) (25) and thus explain associated increased cancer risks.",,Yerba mate | St. Bartholomew’s tea | Jesuit’s tea | Ilex | Hervea | Guyaki Paraguay tea | Chimarrão | Cimmaron,,Mate,Mate,

In Ayurvedic medicine, neem is used externally for skin conditions, internally for gastrointestinal ailments, and for oral hygiene. Several forms of neem extracts are marketed as dietary supplements. Neem has antimicrobial activity and is used against a wide range of pests and parasites . It is effective against lice and has antiretroviral activity . Neem also reduces plaque and decreases oral bacterial counts , but data are conflicting . Its extracts were found to have anti-secretory and anti-ulcer properties , and to improve glycemic control in patients with metabolic syndrome . Neem may also be effective in the treatment of cholera and diarrhea . A few studies have examined the anticancer potential of neem. An ethanolic extract of neem leaves reduced the incidence of chemical-induced gastric tumors in mice , and neem-treated monocytes induced apoptosis in cervical and prostate cancer cells . Neem also showed chemopreventive effects in animal models . However, human data are lacking. Although rare, case reports of poisoning and other severe adverse effects have been associated with the ingestion of neem oil. | Neem (Azadirachta indica) is a tree that grows in tropical regions such as India. The leaf extract is used to reduce tooth plaque and to treat lice. Neem contains chemicals that might help reduce blood sugar levels, heal ulcers in the digestive tract, prevent pregnancy, kill bacteria, and prevent plaque from forming in the mouth. People use neem for lice, tooth plaque, gingivitis, psoriasis, to repel insects, and for many other purposes, but there is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using neem for COVID-19. Neem seed oil is used as a pesticide.","When taken by mouth : Neem bark extract is possibly safe for most adults when used short-term. Doses of up to 60 mg daily for up to 10 weeks have been used safely. Neem is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth in large doses or for long periods of time. It might harm the kidneys and liver. When applied to the skin : Neem oil or cream is possibly safe when applied to the skin for up to 2 weeks. When applied inside the mouth : Neem leaf extract gel is possibly safe when applied inside the mouth for up to 6 weeks. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Neem oil and neem bark are likely unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. They can cause a miscarriage. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if neem is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Neem extract shampoo is possibly safe in children when applied once or twice to the head for 10 minutes, then rinsed with warm water.

These serious side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, drowsiness, seizures, loss of consciousness, coma, and death. ""Auto-immune diseases"" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions : Neem might cause the immune system to become more active. This could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using neem. Reduced ability to have children (infertility) : There is some evidence that neem can harm sperm. It might also reduce fertility in other ways. If you are trying to have children, avoid using neem. Organ transplant : There is a concern that neem might decrease the effect of medications that are used to prevent organ rejection. Do not use neem if you have had an organ transplant. Surgery : Neem might lower blood sugar levels. There is a concern that it might interfere with blood sugar control during and after surgery. Stop using neem at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.","The ulcer-healing properties of nimbidin from neem seeds are attributed to the stearic and palmitic acid components (14). Anti-ulcer effects are believed to be via inhibition of the proton pump, H+- K+- ATPase, to control secretion of hydrochloric acid and gastric mucus depletion, and prevent oxidative mucosal damage (6).
Azadirachta in neem has pestical activity due to its growth-regulating properties, reducing levels of the insect hormone ecdysone (14).
Neem induces cell death in prostate cancer cells by decreasing the levels of Bcl-2, an anti-apoptotic protein. Neem-treated monocytes induce apoptosis in cervical cancer cells by increasing levels of caspases 3, 8 and 9, interferon (IFN-gamma), and by decreasing tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) (10).

Nattō has been consumed as food in Japan for several centuries. Nattokinase is also available as a supplement and is most known for its effects on prevention and treatment of clots and to improve blood circulation. Preliminary studies have explored its antithrombotic and amyloid-plaque degrading abilities . Nattokinase decreases platelet aggregation and thrombus formation in a dose-dependent fashion both in vitro and in vivo . Reduced intimal thickening was observed in the femoral artery of rats that were fed a diet containing nattō . Studies in humans are limited. In a randomized double-blind trial, nattokinase capsules reduced diastolic and systolic blood pressure in prehypertensive patients . However, long-term nattokinase supplementation had a null effect on subclinical atherosclerosis progression and associated biomarkers in a study of healthy individuals at low risk for cardiovascular disease . In subjects with hypercholesterolemia, nattokinase altered hemostatic factors . Other preliminary data suggest it may be helpful as adjuvant therapy in the rehabilitation of stroke patients , but more study is needed. Nattokinase has been promoted as an alternative anticancer treatment based on the notion that it can help dissolve the fibrin coating around a tumor, and increase oxygen supply in the blood to inhibit cancer cell growth. However, these mechanisms have not been proven in humans. Theoretically, nattokinase may increase bleeding risk when used with anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and fibrinolytic drugs. Raw nattō contains high levels of vitamin K that may interfere with the action of warfarin . | Nattokinase is an enzyme that comes from a Japanese food called natto. Natto is made from boiled soybeans that have been fermented with a type of bacteria. Nattokinase may thin the blood and help break up blood clots.

Stop taking it at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.,"In vitro studies show that nattokinase decreases clot formation by cleaving and inactivating the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) via proteolysis at P1-P1’ peptide bond. PAI is a key inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) that converts plasminogen to plasmin. PAI inactivation allows for greater tPA activity and increased lysis of clots (10) (11). In the absence of PAI, nattokinase affects direct proteolysis of fibrin; however, this effect is less than the protelysis achieved by the PAI-mediated pathway (2). The fibrinolytic activity of nattokinase is estimated to be four-fold that of plasmin (12).
Nattokinase is currently being evaluated for its potential as an amyloid plaque-degrading agent. Low doses of nattokinase have been shown to increase expression of the ADAM10 gene, which belongs to a family of proteinases that degrade the amyloid precursor protein. Upregulation of ADAM10 may shift the amyloidogenic pathway to the non-amyloidogenic pathway. This activity may prevent amyloid plaque accumulation that characterizes Alzheimer’s disease (9).",Nattō (soybeans fermented with B. subtilis),"Natto extract | Fermented soybeans | BSP, Extrait de Natto, Fermented Soybeans, Haricots de Soja Fermentés, Natto de Soja, Natto Extract, Nattokinasa, NK, Soy Natto, Subtilisin NAT.",,Nattokinase,Nattokinase,Nattokinase

It bears fleshy yellow-white fruit and is used in traditional medicine for wound healing, infections, diarrhea, skin conditions, and as a tonic. It is also cultivated in Hawaii and other Polynesian islands and is marketed worldwide. Fresh or fermented juices are available as drinks while capsules, pills, and powders are sold as dietary supplements. In preclinical studies noni extracts and its constituents demonstrated antibacterial , antifungal , anti-inflammatory , antidiabetic , hepatoprotective , prokinetic , antitumor , and immunomodulatory properties. Noni also inhibited low-density-lipoprotein oxidation and may be useful in preventing arteriosclerosis ; improved memory in animal models ; and activated cell-mediated immunity . Glycosides, iridoids, and other constituents isolated from noni fruits and leaves exhibited antioxidant properties . In addition, noni juice exerted antiangiogenic effects in an ex vivo assay ; along with altering oxidative stress markers and expression of DNA repair genes in cervical cancer cells . Small clinical studies suggest that noni may help reduce incidence of early postoperative nausea , alleviate cigarette smoke-induced dyslipidemia , and improve hangover symptoms . An extract containing noni, D-mannose, and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may be useful in the prophylaxis of urinary tract infections associated with urological diagnostic procedures . Further research is needed to confirm these effects. Morinda citrifolia should not be confused with Morinda officinalis, also known as Ba Ji Tian, commonly used in Chinese medicine. | Noni (Morinda citrifolia) is an evergreen tree with large leaves and yellow fruit. It's found in the Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, Australia, and India. Noni roots, stem, bark, leaves, flowers, and fruit have all been used as medicine. The fruit juice in particular is very high in potassium. It also contains vitamin C, vitamin A, and many other chemicals that might help repair damaged cells in the body and activate the immune system. People use noni for cancer, high blood pressure, athletic performance, aging skin, diabetes, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. The US FDA has issued multiple warnings to noni manufacturers for making health claims that aren't supported by research.",When taken by mouth : Noni juice is possibly safe when used for up to 3 months. But there are several reports of liver damage in people who consumed noni tea or juice for several weeks. It isn't clear if noni was the cause of these side effects. There isn't enough reliable information to know if noni fruit extract is safe. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if noni is safe or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if noni is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Kidney disease : Noni contains large amounts of potassium. This can be a problem for people with kidney disease. Don't use noni in large amounts if you have kidney problems. High potassium levels : Noni contains large amounts of potassium. Drinking noni fruit juice might increase potassium levels in the blood. Liver disease : Noni has been linked to several cases of liver damage. Avoid using noni if you have liver disease.,"Glycosides isolated from noni juice inhibit AP-1 transactivation and cell transformation in mouse epidermal JB6 cell lines (2). Antidiabetic characteristics of some noni compounds are attributed to inhibition of the protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B enzyme (35). Anti-inflammatory activity in noni extract was attributed to quercetin (34). In addition, noni juice exhibited antioxidant effects by reducing aromatic DNA adducts (5) (19).
In animal models, an aqueous extract of noni root produced a central analgesic effect that was antagonized by naloxone (6). Hepatoprotective effects occur through regulation of lipid homeostasis, antioxidant status, and anti-inflammatory responses (36) (37). The primary iridoid deacetylasperulosidic acid may exert antioxidant effects by increasing superoxide dismutase activity (42). Scopoletin and rutin in noni may be responsible for antidopaminergic and antiadrenergic effects (46). Scopoletin also stimulates gastrointestinal motility by acting as a 5-HT4 receptor agonist (38). Treatment with noni extract prevented memory impairment through increased brain energy metabolism, cholinergic neurotransmission, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and antioxidative activity (40).
When combined with suboptimal doses of certain chemotherapy agents, polysaccharides from noni improved survival time and curative effects (4). Apoptotic effects occur via upregulation of p53 and proapoptotic Bax proteins, as well as downregulation of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2, Bcl-XL proteins and survivin. Increase in caspase 9 and 3 was also reported, which suggests involvement of the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway (31). In cervical cancer cell lines, malondialdehyde levels were significantly reduced when treated with noni, alone or in combination with cisplatin alone (44). The antitumor effects of damnacanthal from noni are attributed to its inhibitory effects on the HGF/c-Met axis in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, with decreases in Akt phosphorylation and matrix metalloproteinase-2 secretion (39). Noni extract induced apoptosis, G1/S phase cell-cycle arrest, and decreased intracellular ROS generation and mitochondrial membrane potential in breast cancer cells (47).",,"Lada | Indian mulberry | Nono | Hog apple | Ba Ji Tian, Bois Douleur, Canarywood, Cheese Fruit, Hai Ba Ji, Hawaiian Noni, Hog Apple, Indian Mulberry, Jus de Noni, Luoling, Mengkudu, Menkoedoe, Mora de la India, Morinda, Morinda citrifolia, Mulberry, Mûre Indienne, Nhau, Noni Juice, Nono, Nonu, Pau-Azeitona, Rotten Cheese Fruit, Ruibarbo Caribe, Tahitian Noni Juice, Ura, Wild Pine, Wu Ning, Yor.",,Noni,Noni,Noni

Don't confuse bitter orange with other orange species such as sweet orange and bergamot. | Sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) is a fruit that contains large amounts of vitamin C. People commonly eat its fruit and drink its juice. Sweet orange contains large amounts of potassium, which might help prevent high blood pressure and stroke. The fruit and juice also contain large amounts of a chemical called citrate, which might help prevent kidney stones. Citrate tends to bind with calcium before it can form a stone. People use sweet orange for asthma, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, the common cold, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Bitter orange is likely safe when eaten in the amounts found in food. But bitter orange is possibly unsafe when taken in the larger amounts used as medicine.

The oil itself is highly toxic, and is not recommended for internal use. Pennyroyal oil contains several monoterpenes, principally pulegone, to which toxic effects on the liver and lungs are attributed. Oxidative metabolites of pugelone such as menthofuran are oxidized further by cytochrome P450 to reactive intermediates that form adducts with cellular proteins and cause organ damage . Ingestion of pennyroyal oil in adults or tea in children causes severe toxicities , including hepatic and renal failure, metabolic acidosis, pulmonary congestion, cerebral edema, seizures, bleeding and clotting disorders, and death. | Pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium) is a plant that grows throughout the world. The leaves, and the oil they contain, are used to make medicine. Pennyroyal essential oil contains chemicals that have various toxic effects in the body. People use pennyroyal for the common cold, pneumonia, fatigue, ending a pregnancy (abortion), and as an insect repellant, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. It is also unsafe.","When taken by mouth : Pennyroyal essential oil is likely unsafe. It can cause serious liver and kidney damage, as well as nervous system damage. Repeated use may lead to death. There isn't enough reliable information to know if pennyroyal leaf is safe to use as a tea. When applied to the skin : Pennyroyal essential oil is likely unsafe. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : It is likely unsafe to take pennyroyal by mouth or apply it to your skin when pregnant. There is some evidence that pennyroyal oil can cause abortions by causing the uterus to contract. But the dose needed in order to cause an abortion could kill the parent or cause life-long kidney and liver damage. Avoid use. Breast-feeding : It is likely unsafe to take pennyroyal by mouth or apply it to your skin while breast-feeding. Avoid use. Children : Pennyroyal is likely unsafe when taken by mouth in children. Infants have developed serious liver and nervous system damage, and even death, after taking pennyroyal. Kidney disease : Pennyroyal essential oil can damage the kidney and make existing kidney disease worse. Liver disease : Pennyroyal essential oil can cause liver damage and might make existing liver disease worse.","Pennyroyal’s abortifacient properties are thought to be due to irritation of the uterus, causing contractions, but lethal doses are necessary for this to occur and the effect is inconsistent. Pennyroyal’s mint properties, attributable to the menthol component, theoretically may act in dilating respiratory passages in bronchitis or asthma when consumed as a tea (5). European and American pennyroyal oil consist of 80-90% and 16-30% (R)-(+)-pulegone, respectively, which is oxidized by CYP450 to menthofuran (about 50%) and other toxic metabolites (4). The menthofuran is further oxidized to an epoxide which is likely the ultimate toxic biological reactive intermediate that causes liver damage (15).

Don't confuse Panax ginseng with other plants sometimes referred to as ginseng like American ginseng, Blue Cohosh, Canaigre, Codonopsis, Eleuthero, or Panax Notoginseng. These are different plants with different effects.","When taken by mouth : Panax ginseng is likely safe when taken for up to 6 months. Panax ginseng is possibly unsafe when taken for more than 6 months. It might have some hormone-like effects that could be harmful when used long-term. The most common side effect is trouble sleeping. Uncommon side effects that have been reported include severe rash, liver damage, and severe allergic reactions. When applied to the skin : There isn't enough reliable information to know if Panax ginseng is safe. It might cause side effects such as irritation and burning. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Panax ginseng is possibly unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. One of the chemicals in Panax ginseng has been found to cause birth defects in animals. Do not use Panax ginseng if you are pregnant. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if Panax ginseng is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Panax ginseng is likely unsafe in infants and children. Panax ginseng has been linked to fatal poisoning in newborns. It's not clear if it's safe in older children. Until more is known, do not use Panax ginseng in children. ""Auto-immune diseases"" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions : Panax ginseng seems to increase the activity of the immune system. It might make auto-immune diseases worse. Don't use Panax ginseng if you have any auto-immune condition. Bleeding conditions : Panax ginseng seems to interfere with blood clotting. Don't use Panax ginseng if you have a bleeding condition. Heart conditions : Panax ginseng can affect heart rhythm and blood pressure slightly on the first day it is used. Use Panax ginseng with caution if you have heart disease. Hormone-sensitive conditions such as breast cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, endometriosis, or uterine fibroids : Panax ginseng contains chemicals (ginsenosides) that can act like estrogen.  If you have any condition that might be made worse by exposure to estrogen, don't use Panax ginseng. Trouble sleeping (insomnia) : High doses of Panax ginseng have been linked with insomnia. If you have trouble sleeping, use Panax ginseng with caution. Suppressed immune system : Panax ginseng might make the immune system more active. This could interfere with the effects of medications that suppress the immune system, such as those given after an organ transplant. If your immune system is suppressed, don't use Panax ginseng. Schizophrenia : High doses of Panax ginseng have been linked with sleep problems and agitation in people with schizophrenia.

DSI006906,Probiotics,,"The term “Probiotic” (Greek for “prolife”) came into being in the 1960s to define substances produced by protozoa, which support the growth of other microorganisms . Following revisions over the years, probiotics are currently defined by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the World Health Organization as “live microorganisms, which when consumed in adequate amounts, confer a health effect on the host” . Most probiotics consist of lactic-acid producing, non-virulent bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Bifidobacterium, Propionibacterium and Enterococcus or non-pathogenic yeasts such as Saccharomyces boulardii. Probiotics have gained immense popularity over the last two decades for their perceived health benefits which include improved digestion, immune function and nutrient absorption but the most important being the reversal of dysbiosis (changes in the function or composition of gut microbes or “microbiota”) that is hypothesized to play a role in the development of several chronic and degenerative diseases . Although gut microbiota is known to develop at birth, nutrition, lifestyle, and changes in the host genome during later years can shift its makeup and activity, which in turn influences overall health and the risk of developing disease. Antibiotic use has also been associated with gut microbiota disruption in general population, increasing the risk of chronic disease ; in patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation , with the greatest shifts occuring between stem cell infusion and reconstitution of healthy immune cells ; as well as in allogeneic bone marrow transplantation patients . Furthermore, antibiotics were found to inhibit the benefits of immune checkpoint-inhibitors in patients with advanced cancer ; and patients who were administered antibiotics before, and not during, immune checkpoint-inhibitor therapy had worse treatment response and overall survival . Research is underway to determine strategies for modulating the gut microbiome to improve immune response in cancer. Probiotic supplements are currently promoted for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, gastroenteritis, irritable bowel syndrome, allergies, dental cavities, and for managing diarrhea induced by antibiotics, by the bacterium Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), and that associated with chemotherapy . The strongest evidence of effectiveness of probiotics is for acute infectious diarrhea . Supplementation also was shown useful in alleviating antibiotic-associated diarrhea . Although RCTs did not find benefit for managing C. difficile-associated diarrhea , data suggest effectiveness in preventing C. difficile infection and for pouchitis (inflammation of the ileal pouch in post-colectomy patients). Interestingly, even though a range of products were shown useful in treating and sustaining remissions of mild to moderately active ulcerative colitis, findings on Crohn’s disease are not promising . Based on the association of intestinal bacteria with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), supplementation has been explored in a few studies with promising findings but well-designed trials are lacking . In a study of patients with systemic sclerosis, probiotics did not improve gastrointestinal symptoms . Analyses of the National Health and Nutrition survey results revealed consumption of yogurt or probiotics reduces the risk of proteinuric kidney disease , but definitive conclusions of benefit against urinary tract infections or bacterial vaginosis are lacking. Probiotic use was also shown to increase resistance to risk factors associated with dental caries in an RCT , and to improve memory impairment in a murine model . Probiotics conferred a moderate benefit for eczema prevention but not for other allergic conditions . Supplementation also reduced glycemic and inflammatory markers in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease . But evidence to support its role in managing cystic fibrosis is lacking . In other studies, supplementation did not prevent influenza in women healthcare workers , nor bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women , but shortened the healing time in patients with lactational breast abscesses . As increasing evidence indicates that gut bacteria are important determinants of metabolic disorders, probiotics are being investigated as a possible therapeutic option. Thus far, benefits were reported against obesity and diabetes . Meta analyses suggest that supplementation helps reduce periodontal parameters and halitosis associated with severe periodontitis , helps prevent oral candidiasis in the elderly , may lower fasting blood glucose level in adults and improve lipid metabolism by lowering the levels of LDL and total cholesterol . Another important application of probiotic therapy is in pediatrics for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and allergies. Meta analyses indicate enteral supplementation is effective in preventing severe necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants . A significant reduction in acute diarrhea was also reported in children, independent of the bacterial strains employed . Additional studies showed efficacy of probiotics against antibiotic-associated diarrhea and for lowering the incidence of eczema in late infancy . But available evidence does not support use for allergic diseases , and data are insufficient to assess effects in children with short bowel syndrome, a malabsorption disorder . Preliminary studies indicate that probiotics may also have anti-carcinogenic potential. Oral administration of Lactobacillus casei BL23 had a protective effect against dimethyl hydrazine-induced colorectal cancer , and a probiotic mixture attenuated the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma . A murine melanoma model suggests that manipulating microbiota may modulate cancer immunotherapy by enhancing antitumor immunity through administering a Bifidobacterium strain . Gut microbiome may also modulate responses to anti PD-1 immunotherapy in melanoma patients . Epidemiological data suggest an association between consumption of non-pasteurized dairy products and lower incidence of colorectal cancer . Probiotics may also aid in controlling symptoms associated with cancer treatments: Systematic reviews found supplementation to affect reductions in the severity and frequency of treatment-associated diarrhea, and the need for anti-diarrheal medication in cancer patients ; and to promote recovery of gastrointestinal function following gastrointestinal cancer surgery and craniotomy ; In colorectal cancer patients, perioperative probiotic treatment reduced surgical site infections , improved bowel function , and a systematic review concluded that probiotics/synbiotics help modulate enteric microbiota, improve postoperative outcomes, gut barrier function and reduce inflammatory parameters . Probiotics may also help prevent chemo-related cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients ; decrease severity of chemo- and radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma ; and reduce oral Candida following radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer , although supplementation was ineffective in preventing radiation-induced mucositis . A systematic review evaluating probiotics in oncological surgery found substantial risk of bias across majority of the studies analyzed, warranting the need for well-designed studies . Additional strategies used to modulate gut microbiota include “prebiotics” and “fecal microbiota transplantation” (FMT). Prebiotics or functional foods are non-digestible food ingredients that benefit the host by selectively promoting growth or activity of helpful gut bacteria. Currently used prebiotics include the fructans inulin and fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS), and lactulose. Data on prebiotics for IBS are conflicting . Because probiotics are short-lived, prebiotics are being co-administered to maintain their levels in the gut, and this combination is called “synbiotic therapy”. It was reported useful in controlling symptoms associated with IBS ; and may also benefit gut functioning in healthy community-dwelling elders . FMT involves administration of fecal matter from a healthy donor into a recipient by enema, colonoscopy or through the upper gastrointestinal tract in the form of oral capsules, via nasogastric, nasoduodenal or nasoenteric tube, or by endoscopy, to restore normal gut flora. FMT may benefit IBS patients although the quality of evidence is low . In oncology settings, FMT was found effective against immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-associated colitis ; and autologous fecal microbiota transplantation (auto-FMT), for reestablishing intestinal microbiota composition in patients with gut microbiota depletion due to antibiotic treatment during allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . A synbiotic mouthwash was effective in reducing and preventing oral mucositis intensity in oral cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy . Synbiotic supplements also reduced chemo-induced diarrhea in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia . In summary, available data suggest probiotics may improve certain health outcomes by inducing favorable changes in the intestinal bacteria. But the overall evidence to support their use is limited due to small sample size, poor methodology, variation in the species and strains of bacteria, and in the dosage and duration of administration. Variation in the response to probiotics is also an important factor to consider because genes that respond to probiotic intake were shown to be strain-specific and to cluster according to the individual and not by intervention . Furthermore, gut colonization is not always achieved despite supplementation with probiotics . In another study that examined post-antibiotic recovery in humans, administration of probiotics was associated with a delay in gut-microbiome reconstitution . Well-designed studies and specific recommendations are needed to establish probiotic use for different age groups and disorders, and to determine long-term safety. Of note, early observational data suggest that indiscriminate use of commercially available probiotics may be harmful in the setting of immune checkpoint blockade treatment in cancer patients .",,"Proposed mechanisms by which probiotics influence colonization in the gut include production of inhibitory compounds to suppress the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, and production of substrates to promote the growth of beneficial bacteria. Probiotics can also indirectly influence shifts in microbiota by interacting with the mucosal system, which affects systemic immunity; and by reducing pro-inflammatory markers implicated in many disorders (34) (35).
Studies using murine models indicate that administration of S. boulardii to type-2 diabetic and obese mice resulted in reduced inflammation, body weight, fat mass, and hepatic steatosis, along with decreased bacterial population that has been previously associated with obesity and type-2 diabetes (36). Probiotic treatment also affected a reduction in food intake and an improvement in glucose tolerance via release of the hormone glucagon-like protein-1 (GLP-1), a physiological regulator of appetite and food intake (37).
Immunomodulation is one of the ways in which probiotics are thought to influence host health. A subspecies of Bifidobacterium longum prevented Salmonella-associated infection in mice by inducing T-regulatory cells and by attenuating the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B, which plays a role in the expression of pro-inflammatory genes (38). Induction of T-regulatory cells was also shown in humans along with a reduction in pro-inflammatory biomarkers (39). In addition probiotic administration was shown to reduce pain perception, and to induce changes in the colonic expression of genes that mediate pain and inflammation (40). And a probiotic mixture reduced the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma by shifting the gut microbes toward beneficial bacteria, which produce anti-inflammatory metabolites (24). Protective effects of probiotics were also reported in a murine model of mammary carcinogenesis. Oral administration of a supplement containing Lactobacillus reuteri resulted in inhibition of mammary tumor formation by triggering CD4+/CD25+ lymphocytes, which play a critical role in controlling immune responses (41). Because intestinal bacteria have been shown to influence carcinogenesis and response to anticancer therapy, manipulating them selectively may be a potential strategy to enhance the efficacy of anticancer treatments (66).","Yogurt, miso, tempeh, kefir, pickled vegetables, sauerkraut, kimchi and buttermilk","

In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that pygeum extracts have bactericidal and fungicidal activity , antagonize the androgen receptor , and have antiproliferative and apoptotic effects against prostate cancer cells . Clinical studies suggest effectiveness of pygeum and formulations containing pygeum and other herbs to improve urinary symptoms associated with BPH. However, additional larger studies are needed to demonstrate usefulness of pygeum compared with standard treatments in current use for BPH. | Pygeum is the name for extracts, teas, and supplements that come from the bark of a tree native to Africa called Prunus africana. Pygeum contains chemicals that help shrink the prostate in males with enlarged prostates. This might relieve urinary problems such as poor urine flow and nighttime urination. People most commonly use pygeum for treating symptoms of enlarged prostate (BPH). It is also used for fever, malaria, kidney disease, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these other uses.",When taken by mouth : Pygeum is likely safe for most people. Doses of 75-200 mg daily have been used safely for up to 12 months. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if pygeum is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.,"Pygeum antagonizes 5-lipoxygenase metabolite production, and this action may contribute to its anti-inflammatory effects (15). Antimicrobial effects have been linked to inhibition of IL-7 mRNA expression (2).
The isolated compounds atraric acid and N-butylbenzene-sulfonamide were identified as androgen receptor antagonists, which play an important role in the development of prostate diseases (16).
Antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of pygeum on prostate fibroblasts and myofibroblasts are due to downregulation of transforming growth factor B1 and inhibition of fibroblast growth factor 2-specific signaling (6).",,"African plum tree | African Plum Tree, African Prune, African Pygeum, Amande Amère, Ciruelo Africano, Prunier d'Afrique, Prunus africana, Pygeum africanum, Pygeum Africanus.",,Pygeum,Pygeum,Pygeum

It was first marketed as a dietary supplement in the United States by Pharmanex under the trade name Cholestin . The active constituent, monacolin K, is the same as lovastatin, an active ingredient in the cholesterol-lowering drug . A number of clinical trials have demonstrated effectiveness of red yeast rice preparations in reducing cholesterol levels in hyperlipidemic patients , but meta-analyses are mixed on whether it is safe , with one citing a lack of regulation and standardized formulations. One of the extracts tested also did not lower blood pressure in hypertensive patients . In another study, co-supplementation with Coenzyme Q10 was found to be associated with improved LDL-cholesterolemia and endothelial reactivity in moderately hypercholesterolemic subjects . It is important to note that several preparations of red rice yeast contain citrinin, a toxic fermentation byproduct . | Red yeast rice is the product of rice fermented with a type of yeast called Monascus purpureus. It contains monacolin K, which is identical to a statin drug. Red yeast rice contains ten different chemicals known as monacolins. These chemicals affect cholesterol levels. Monacolin K, which is the same as the drug lovastatin, is the most abundant in red yeast rice. Because of this, it has many of the same effects and precautions as the statin drug. People most commonly use red yeast rice for high levels of cholesterol and other fats in the blood. It is also used for heart attack, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these other uses. The US FDA considers red yeast rice products that contain significant amounts of statin-like ingredients to be illegal, unapproved drugs. But many of these products are still available. Red yeast rice products do not always contain consistent amounts of statins, which can change their effects on health.","When taken by mouth : Red yeast rice is possibly safe for most people when taken for up to 4.5 years. Red yeast rice contains a chemical that is the same as the prescription drug lovastatin. Because of this, it might cause the same side effects as this drug, including liver damage, severe muscle pain, and muscle damage. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Red yeast rice is likely unsafe when taken by mouth during pregnancy. Some chemicals in red yeast rice have caused birth defects in animals. Avoid using it while pregnant. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if it is safe to use red yeast rice when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Liver problems : Red yeast rice contains a chemical that is the same as the statin drug lovastatin. Lovastatin can cause liver damage. Red yeast rice products should be used cautiously or avoided in people with liver problems.","Components such as citrinin, monacolines and monankarin, and monascopyridines have been isolated from red yeast rice (10). Fermentation products are standardized to contain 0.4% 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors.

DSI007199,Soy,,"Soybeans are rich in protein and other essential nutrients and are widely consumed as food. Soy also contains significant amounts of isoflavones including genistein, daidzein, and glycitein. They are marketed as dietary supplements for hot flashes, high cholesterol, cardiovascular health, and cancer prevention. Soy isoflavones exhibit both selective estrogen receptor modulator activity and non-hormonal effects. Studies are mixed on whether soy can relieve menopausal symptoms or slow bone loss . Other analyses suggest no protective effects against diabetes , and lack of benefit in patients with Alzheimer’s disease or poorly controlled asthma . However, there may be cardiovascular benefits with soy products as studies show soy intake lowers blood pressure and cholesterol levels . Soy has also been evaluated for anticancer effects. Although it may reduce risk of prostate , lung , and endometrial cancers, high or prolonged intakes may increase risk of bladder cancer , endometrial hyperplasia , and mortality . Prior soy intake was associated with prolonged survival among women with lung cancer , but no associations were found between soy and risk of liver or colorectal cancers. Studies in breast cancer patients are mixed. Although it may help prevent breast cancer or recurrence , or reduce mortality , soy intake or supplementation did not modulate risk , decrease overall risk . Data are also conflicting on whether it affects mammographic density . Other findings suggest potential adverse effects or that supplementation can stimulate overexpression of breast cancer genes in some patients . Soy supplementation was also not helpful against prostate cancer progression , for high-risk patients post-surgery , or for treatment-related hot flashes . Other limited data suggest isoflavone supplementation may reduce some side effects from radiation or chemotherapy , but larger studies are needed. Preclinical data suggest higher intakes of soy or specific isoflavones may promote growth or metastasis or antagonize the effects of tamoxifen . Patients should consult their physicians about the use of soy supplements, whose long-term safety remains to be determined. | Soy (Glycine max) comes from soybeans. The beans are a legume that come from China. They can be processed into soy protein, soy milk, or soy fiber. Soy contains isoflavones which are changed in the body to phytoestrogens. Phytoestrogen molecules are similar in chemical structure to the hormone estrogen. In some cases, these phytoestrogens can mimic the effects of estrogen. In other cases, these phytoestrogens can block the effects of estrogen. Soy is used for high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, symptoms of menopause, and premenstrual syndrome (PMS). It is also used for many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support many of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Soy is commonly consumed in foods. Dietary supplements containing soy extracts are possibly safe when used for up to 6 months. Soy can cause some mild stomach and intestinal side effects such as constipation, bloating, and nausea. It can also cause allergic reactions involving rash, itching, and breathing problems in some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Soy is commonly consumed in foods. However, soy is possibly unsafe when used in the larger amounts found in medicine when pregnant. Higher doses during pregnancy might harm development of the baby. Breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if soy is safe to use in the larger amounts found in medicine when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts. Children : Soy is commonly consumed in foods. Giving infants soy formula doesn't seem to cause health or reproductive problems later in life. But soy milk that is not designed for infants should not be used as a substitute for infant formula. Regular soy milk could lead to nutrient deficiencies. Soy is possibly unsafe when used as an alternative to cow's milk in children who are allergic to cow's milk. Although soy protein-based infant formulas are often promoted for children with milk allergy, these children are often allergic to soy as well. Don't give children soy in amounts larger than what is found in food or formula. Researchers don't know whether soy is safe for children at higher doses. Breast cancer : The effects of soy in people with breast cancer are unclear. Because there isn't enough reliable information about the effects of soy in females with breast cancer, a history of breast cancer, or a family history of breast cancer, it's best to avoid using soy supplements until more is known. Allergy to peanuts and related plants : Soy might cause serious allergic reactions in people who are allergic to peanuts and other members of the Fabaceae plant family. Under-active thyroid (hypothyroidism) : Some people with this condition also have low iodine levels. Taking soy might make this condition worse in people who have low iodine levels. Kidney failure : Soy contains a chemical called phytoestrogens. People with kidney failure who use soy products might have blood levels of phytoestrogens become too high. If you have kidney failure, avoid taking large amounts of soy. Kidney stones : Soy products might increase the risk of kidney stones. Soy products contain large amounts of chemicals called oxalates. Oxalates are the main ingredient in kidney stones. If you have a history of kidney stones, avoid taking large amounts of soy. Milk allergy : Children who are very allergic to cow's milk might also be sensitive to soy products. Use soy products with caution. Bladder cancer : Soy products might increase the chance of getting bladder cancer. Avoid soy foods if you have bladder cancer or are at high risk of getting it.","Soy isoflavones may modulate bone remodeling via estrogen receptors (ER) by regulating target gene expression (49). Isoflavones may inhibit LDL oxidation and alter hepatic metabolism with enhanced removal of LDL and VLDL by hepatocytes (13). Serum lipids may also be regulated via modified transcription factor and downstream gene expression and by promoting antioxidant enzyme activity (50).
Various mechanisms have been proposed for soy’s anticancer effects. Genistein affects microRNA expression-targeted translation inhibitors for multiple proteins implicated in regulating various pathobiological processes (51). It also demonstrated an anti-minichromosome maintenance effect, a gene family upregulated in various cancers and considered a promising drug target (52).
In breast cancer cells, genistein acts as an agonist in ER-alpha-predominant cells, but likely acts as an antiestrogen in cells with ER-beta alone, suggesting therapeutic potential for premenopausal women with ER-alpha-negative/ER-beta-positive tumors (53). However, genistein induces estrogen-dependent MCF-7 tumor cell growth and increases breast cancer-associated aromatase expression/activity, suggesting that soy-based supplements may affect aromatase inhibitor efficacy (54). Genistein is also known to negate tamoxifen’s inhibitory effect on MCF-7 tumor growth and increase expression of estrogen-responsive genes (47). Some benefits ascribed to dietary isoflavones may depend on early life exposure, thereby impacting gene expression at the epigenetic level (55).
In prostate tumors, soy protein reduced androgen receptor expression (56). Both genistein and daidzein affect microRNA regulation (57) and induce decreased methylation of gene promoters including BRCA1 (58). In TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand-resistant prostate cancer cells, soy isoflavones enhance TRAIL-mediated apoptosis by engaging apoptotic pathways and regulating NF-κB activity (59). However, in a patient-derived prostate cancer xenograft model, increased proliferation and metastasis in genistein-treated groups were linked to enhanced activities of tyrosine kinases, EGFR, and its downstream Src (45). Both genistein and daidzein also act as radiosensitizers for prostate cancer, but pure genistein increased lymph node metastasis, whereas the combination of genistein, daidzein, and glycitein did not. Daidzein may protect against genistein-induced metastasis, and its ability to inhibit cell growth and potentiate radiation appears to be androgen-receptor-independent (60). In addition, soy isoflavones radiosensitized human A549 NSCLC cells, and decreased hemorrhages, inflammation, and fibrosis caused by radiation suggesting protection of normal lung tissue (61).","Raw soybeans, low-fat soy flour, roasted soybeans, dry-roasted soy beans, soy milk, tofu, and soy protein isolate.

Stevia extract is many times sweeter than table sugar , but only purified steviol glycosides have the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) status by the FDA for use in food . Preclinical studies show that stevia has anti-inflammatory , hepatoprotective and renoprotective effects . Small clinical studies found stevia to reduce hypertension and hyperglycemia , but a meta-analysis of steviol glycosides on type 2 diabetes biomarkers did not find significant benefit . In an RCT comparing low-calorie sweeteners, ingestion of rebaudioside did not appear to affect body weight . Additional studies are needed to clarify any benefits. | Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) is a bushy shrub native to northeast Paraguay, Brazil, and Argentina. It's best known as a natural sweetener. Stevia contains chemicals that are 200-300 times sweeter than sucrose sugar. People take stevia for obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. In the US, stevia leaves and extracts are available as supplements, but are not approved for use as sweeteners. Rebaudioside A (also called rebiana), one of the chemicals in stevia, is approved as a food sweetener.","When taken by mouth : Certain chemicals in stevia, including stevioside and rebaudioside A, are likely safe when used as a food sweetener.

The fresh and dried forms of the mushroom are commonly used in East Asian cooking. It is also valued as an anticancer agent. Lentinan (1,3 beta-D-glucan), a polysaccharide isolated from shiitake, is thought to be responsible for its beneficial effects. Although it has been shown to have anticancer effects , lentinan is considered a biological response modifier, rather than having a direct cytotoxic effect on tumor cells . Preclinical studies conducted with shiitake extracts revealed immunostimulatory , antiviral , hepatoprotective , antihypercholemic , antiproliferative , cytotoxic , antimutagenic , and anticaries properties. Small randomized studies found shiitake to alter immune function in young adults , a useful adjuvant for preventing dyslipidemia in adults with borderline high cholesterol , and to modulate intestinal microbiota in hypercholesterolemic adults . In patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer, an orally administered shiitake mycelial extract decreased the incidence of chemotherapy-associated adverse effects ; and in combination with immunotherapy, improved QOL in cancer patients , although a polysaccharide/oligosaccharide complex from a shiitake extract failed to show effectiveness in the treatment of prostate cancer . More well-designed studies are needed to establish shiitake as a useful adjunct to cancer treatment. | Shiitake mushroom (Lentinus edodes) is a type of edible fungus. It's native to Japan and China, and contains a chemical called lentinan. Shiitake mushrooms are the second most commonly eaten mushrooms in the world. Lentinan and other chemicals in shiitake mushrooms might stimulate the immune system. People use shiitake mushroom for HIV/AIDS, common cold, flu, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Shiitake mushroom is likely safe when cooked and eaten in food amounts. It is possibly unsafe when used in larger amounts as medicine, or when the uncooked mushroom is eaten. It can cause stomach discomfort, blood abnormalities, and skin swelling. It might also make the skin more sensitive to the sun and can cause allergic skin reactions and breathing problems in some people. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if shiitake mushroom is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and stick to food amounts. ""Auto-immune diseases"" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions : Shiitake mushroom might cause the immune system to become more active. This could increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have one of these conditions, it's best to avoid using shiitake mushroom. A blood disorder called hypereosinophilic syndrome : Don't use shiitake mushroom if you have this condition. It might make it worse.","Supplementation with shiitake mushroom enhanced gut immunity by upregulating interleukin (IL)-23 secretion in a murine model of acute dextran sodium sulfate-colitis (29). Shiitake extracts and the polysaccharide lentinan also exerted antiviral effects, by acting on initial replication processes of poliovirus type 1 (PV-1) and bovine herpes virus type 1 (BoHV-1) (31). Another polysaccharide isolated from shiitake exhibited antibacterial effects in mice by increasing T-helper (Th1) cell immunity, resulting in activation of macrophage-mediated immune response (32). Lentin exhibited antifungal properties, inhibited proliferation of leukemic cells, and suppressed activity of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (3). Shiitake consumption in adults altered immune function via increased proliferation of gamma delta-T and NK-T cells, increased secretory immunoglobulin A in saliva, increased IL-1alpha, IL-4, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels, and decreased macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha/chemokine C-C ligand 3 (MIP-1alpha/CCL3) levels (41). A low-molecular-weight lignin from shiitake inhibited hepatitis C virus by binding to viral apolipoprotein E (apoE) before interacting with cell surface heparan sulfate (38).
Eritadenine from shiitake may exert antihypercholemic effects and regulate lipid metabolism by inhibiting S-adenosyl homocysteine hydrolase activity, and supplementation with both eritadenine and shiitake mushroom upregulated CYP7A1 mRNA expression that was decreased in hypercholesterolemic mice (39). High doses of shiitake mushroom prevented obesity in rats by increasing plasma triacylglycerol accumulation in the liver (30).
Additional studies showed that dried shiitake extract caused apoptosis in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells by mediating caspase-3 and -8 pathways  (21). Inhibition of lung cancer cells by the Latcripin-13 domain isolated from shiitake was shown to be due to apoptotic induction (40). Anticancer effects of the polysaccharide lentinan (1,3 beta-D-glucan) may be due to its ability to suppress cytochrome P450 1A enzymes that are known to metabolize procarcinogens to active forms (2). Polysaccharides SLNT1 and JLNT1 isolated from the mushroom also demonstrated antitumor effects by increasing serum IL-2 levels and TNF-α production, and by inducing apoptosis in tumor cells in mice (33).",Fresh or dried whole mushroom,"Forest mushroom | Lentinula | Pasania fungus | Hua gu | Champignon Noir, Champignon Parfumé, Champignon Shiitake, Champignons Shiitake, Forest Mushroom, Hongos Shiitake, Hua Gu, Lenticus edodes, Lentin, Lentin des Chênes, Lentin du Chêne, Lentinan edodes, Lentinula, Lentinula edodes, Lentinus edodes, Mushroom, Pasania Fungus, Shitake, Shiitake, Snake Butter, Tricholomopsis edodes, Xiang Gu.",,Shiitake Mushroom Protein | Shiitake Mushroom,Shiitake Mushroom,Shiitake Mushroom

DSI007385,Sassafras,C0524953,"Sassafras is a perennial tree native to Eastern United States. Native Americans used infusions made from its root bark as a remedy to treat fevers, diarrhea, and rheumatism. It was also used to scent perfume and even as a flavoring for root beer. Studies of sassafras are quite limited and have only been conducted in vitro or in animals. A few experiments suggested antidiabetic and anticancer effects . However, safrole was shown to be a carcinogen , causing it to be banned as a food additive since the 1960s . Based on these data, the FDA continues to classify safrole as a Substance Generally Prohibited From Direct Addition or Use as Human Food . | Sassafras is a plant. The root bark is used to make medicine. Despite serious safety concerns, people use sassafras for many conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. In beverages and candy, sassafras was used in the past to flavor root beer. It was also used as a tea. But sassafras tea contains a lot of safrole, the chemical in sassafras that makes it poisonous. One cup of tea made with 2.5 grams of sassafras contains about 200 mg of safrole. This is about 4.5 times the dose that researchers think is poisonous. So, in 1976, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) ruled that sassafras could no longer be sold as sassafras tea.","When taken by mouth : Sassafras is POSSIBLY SAFE in foods and beverages if it is ""safrole-free."" In medicinal amounts, taking safrole-free sassafras is POSSIBLY UNSAFE . Some scientists think even safrole-free sassafras can increase the risk of cancer. Sassafras containing safrole is LIKELY UNSAFE in the amounts found in medicine. Don't take it by mouth. The safrole in sassafras root bark and oil can cause cancer and liver damage. Consuming just 5 mL of sassafras oil can kill an adult. Sassafras can cause sweating and hot flashes. High amounts can cause vomiting, high blood pressure, hallucinations, and other severe side effects. When applied to the skin : Sassafras containing safrole is LIKELY UNSAFE for use as a medicine. Don't put it on your skin. The safrole in sassafras root bark and oil can cause cancer and liver damage. It can cause skin rashes in some people when used on the skin. Special Precautions & Warnings: It is UNSAFE for anyone to use sassafras in medicinal amounts, but some people have extra reasons not to use it: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Sassafras is LIKELY UNSAFE if you are pregnant. There is evidence that sassafras oil might cause a miscarriage. There isn't enough reliable information to know if it is safe to use when breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Sassafras is LIKELY UNSAFE for children. A few drops of sassafras oil may be deadly. Surgery : In medicinal amounts, sassafras can slow down the central nervous system. This means it can cause sleepiness and drowsiness. When combined with anesthesia and other medications used during and after surgery, it might slow down the central nervous system too much. Stop using sassafras at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery. Urinary tract conditions : Sassafras might make these conditions worse.","Safrole, the main active constituent, shows cytotoxic effects in human tongue squamous carcinoma SCC-4 cells by apoptosis via the mitochondria- and caspase-dependent signal pathways (7); and through the endoplasmic reticulum stress and intrinsic signaling pathways in human leukemia HL-60 cells (9). It also suppressed myelomonocytic leukemia WEHI-3 cells in vivo, and stimulated macrophage phagocytosis and natural killer cell cytotoxicity in leukemic mice (8).
Toxic effects of safrole in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were shown to be via induction of an increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ by causing Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum in a phospholipase C- and protein kinase C-independent fashion, and by inducing Ca2+ influx (16).
However, despite potential apoptotic and cytotoxic effects, data indicates that safrole is “Reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen” (5).",,"Ague tree | Saxifrax | Cinnamonwood | Saloop | Smelling-stick | Ague Tree, Bois de Cannelle, Cinnamon Wood, Common Sassafras, Kuntze Saloop, Laurier des Iroquois, Laurus albida, Saloop, Sasafras, Sassafrax, Sassafras albidum, Sassafras officinale, Sassafras variifolium, Saxifrax.",,Sassafras,Sassafras,Sassafras

They can be extracted from human or animal white blood cells, from cloned lymphocytes, or from colostrum and egg yolk. The parent lymphocyte’s delayed-type hypersensitivity and cell-mediated immunity is passed along to non-immune recipients, and appears to function across species. In animal models, transfer factors were shown to reduce tumor size and increase peripheral blood T-lymphocyte counts . In humans, preliminary studies suggest transfer factors are well tolerated and may have some efficacy for the treatment of herpes , acute infection in children , chronic fatigue syndrome , and candidiasis . One study showed effectiveness in increasing white blood cells, CD8 lymphocytes, and IL-2 levels among patients with HIV . However, transfer factors were reported ineffective in treating hepatitis , multiple sclerosis , extrinsic bronchial asthma , warts , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , and acne vulgaris . Transfer factors were also ineffective against malignant melanoma , nasopharyngeal carcinoma , bronchogenic carcinoma , Hodgkin’s disease , osteogenic sarcoma , and mycosis fungoides . However, in a study of children with leukemia, immunization with transfer factors conferred protection against varicella-zoster infection . Other preliminary data suggest increased survival rates among patients with early stage lung and cervical cancers . Overall, there is a paucity of large randomized controlled clinical trials, and a need for further research into the effectiveness of transfer factors. | A transfer factor is a chemical that is taken from a human or animal that has already developed protection (immunity) against a certain disease. So far, transfer factors for various diseases have been produced only in laboratories for experimental use. Researchers claim that transfer factors can pass along immunity to people who need it. Transfer factors are given as shots or taken by mouth. Transfer factors are most commonly used for infections, often in people with weak immune systems.  Transfer factors are also used for other conditions including various cancers, Crohn disease, chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support any of these uses.","When taken by mouth : Transfer factors that have been taken from humans or cows are POSSIBLY SAFE in adults. They can cause fever in some people. There is some concern about the possibility of catching ""mad cow disease"" (bovine spongiform encephalitis, BSE) or other diseases from products that come from animals. ""Mad cow disease"" has not been transmitted by transfer factor, but it is probably wise to avoid animal products from countries where mad cow disease has been found. When given as a shot into the muscle or under the skin : Transfer factors that have been taken from humans or cows are POSSIBLY SAFE when given as a shot to adults. They might cause fever in some people. They may also cause swelling and pain where the injection is given.

""Mad cow disease"" has not been transmitted by transfer factor, but it is probably wise to avoid animal products from countries where mad cow disease has been found. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There is not enough reliable information about the safety of taking transfer factor if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. Children : Transfer factor from humans or cows is POSSIBLY SAFE in children.","Transfer factors contain many molecules, some of which act in an antigen-specific manner, while others appear to have immunomodulating capabilities (1). Human leukocyte dialysates (DLE) contain low molecular peptides that were characterized in the late 1980s as amino terminal ends of enkephalins. A low molecular weight sub fraction derived from DLE, IMREG-1 has been shown to enhance cell-mediated immunity (22).
In vitro, cells of both murine recipients and humans treated for herpes zoster virus infection secrete gamma-interferon in response to transfer factors (2) (23).

DSI007479,Tetrahydrocannabinol,C0039663,"Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is a cannabinoid found in cannabis (Cannabis sativa). The psychoactive effects of cannabis are mainly due to THC. There are over 80 cannabinoids in Cannabis sativa, but THC and cannabidiol (CBD) are the most well-studied. THC works by binding to specific sites in the brain and on the nerves. It's found in the highest levels in the leaves and flowers of the plant. THC is commonly used as a recreational drug. People also use THC for multiple sclerosis (MS), nerve pain, nausea and vomiting from chemotherapy, alcohol use disorder, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. There is also no good evidence to support using THC for COVID-19. Don't confuse THC with other cannabinoids found in cannabis, including cannabichromene (CBC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabidivarin (CBDV), cannabigerol (CBG), cannabinol (CBN), delta-8-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-8-THC), or tetrahydrocannabivarin (THCV). Also don't confuse it with synthetic cannabinoids such as K2/Spice, or with plants containing THC, such as cannabis or hemp. These are not the same. THC is illegal on the federal level in the US. Due to its THC content, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance. But some states have legalized or decriminalized recreational use.","When taken by mouth : THC is possibly unsafe when used in large amounts or long-term. Edible cannabis containing 50 mg or more of THC has been linked with serious side effects. Regularly taking large amounts of THC might cause cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). CHS leads to severe nausea and vomiting that doesn't respond to typical anti-nausea drugs. Also, using THC for at least 1-2 weeks can cause dependence. When inhaled : THC is possibly unsafe when used in large amounts or long-term. Smoking or vaping THC can cause breathing problems. Vaping products containing THC have been linked to serious lung injury. Regularly smoking cannabis containing THC may cause CHS and/or dependence. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy : Using THC is unsafe during pregnancy. The chemicals in cannabis, including THC, pass through the placenta and can slow the growth of the fetus and increase the risk for premature birth, stillbirth, childhood leukemia, abnormalities, or the need for intensive care after birth. It can also lead to lower intelligence and emotional problems in the child when they grow up. It also increases the risk for anemia and high blood pressure while pregnant. Breast-feeding : Using THC is likely unsafe while breast-feeding. THC passes into breastmilk and stays in breastmilk for longer than 6 weeks, even after THC use has been stopped. This might slow down the development of the baby. Avoid all THC use if planning to breastfeed. Bipolar disorder : Using THC might make manic symptoms worse in people with bipolar disorder. Heart disease : THC might cause fast heartbeat and high blood pressure. It might also increase the risk of having a heart attack. Epilepsy : High doses of THC might cause seizures in people with epilepsy. There have been several reports where high doses of cannabis that contains THC have caused seizures. Schizophrenia : Using THC might make symptoms of schizophrenia worse. Surgery : THC affects the central nervous system. It might slow the central nervous system too much when combined with anesthesia and other medications during and after surgery. Stop using THC at least 2 weeks before a scheduled surgery.",,,"Amber, BHO, Black Glass, Budder, Butane Hash Oil, Butane Honey Oil, Butter, Dabs, Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol, Delta-9 THC, Delta-9-THC, Ear Wax, Glass, Honeycomb, Liquid THC, Marijuana Wax, Sap, Shatter, Wax, Wax Butter.",,Tetrahydrocannabinol,,Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)

DSI007517,Tea Tree Oil,C0216194,"Tea tree oil is an essential oil distilled from the leaves of Melaleuca alternifolia, a plant native to Australia. It has been used in traditional medicine for its antiseptic and anti-inflammatory properties to treat various skin conditions and infections. It has also been incorporated into many topical formulations to treat cutaneous infections, speed wound healing, and as an ingredient in skin and hair products. In vitro studies suggest wide-spectrum antimicrobial , antiviral , antiprotozoal , anti-inflammatory and antiproliferative properties. Animal studies also suggest cytotoxic effects . Preliminary studies in humans suggest various topical tea tree oil formulations may help treat acne , athlete’s foot , fungal nail infections , histamine-induced skin inflammation , warts , cold sores , chalazia , and dermatitis . However, additional studies are needed to confirm under what conditions topical applications may be effective. | Tea tree oil comes from the leaves of the tea tree (Melaleuca alternifolia). It grows in the swampy southeast Australian coast. The tea tree was named by eighteenth century sailors, who made tea that smelled like nutmeg from the leaves of the tree. The chemicals in tea tree oil might kill bacteria, fungus, and mites, and reduce allergic skin reactions by decreasing swelling. People use tea tree oil for acne, toenail fungus, and athlete's foot. It's also used for dandruff, lice, bad breath, and other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support its other uses. Do not confuse the tea tree with the unrelated common tea plant that is used to make black and green teas.","When taken by mouth : Tea tree oil is likely unsafe; don't take tea tree oil by mouth. Taking tree tea oil by mouth has caused serious side effects, including confusion, inability to walk, unsteadiness, rash, and coma. When applied to the skin : Tea tree oil is possibly safe for most people. It may cause skin irritation and swelling. In people with acne, it can sometimes cause skin dryness, itching, stinging, burning, and redness. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : Tea tree oil is possibly safe when applied to the skin. However, it is likely unsafe if taken by mouth. Ingestion of tea tree oil can be toxic. Children : Tea tree oil is likely unsafe when taken by mouth. It has caused serious side effects, including confusion, inability to walk, unsteadiness, rash, and coma. Applying tea tree oil to the skin is possibly safe. It may cause skin irritation and swelling. In people with acne, it can sometimes cause skin dryness, itching, stinging, burning, and redness. Cross-reactions : Applying tea tree oil might cause skin itching and burning in people with allergies to other plants.","Terpinen-4-ol, a major constituent of tea tree oil, exhibited antimicrobial activity against Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Terpin-4-ol, alpha-terpineol, and alpha-pinene also had antimicrobial effects against Staphylococcus epidermidis and Propionibacterium acnes (2). Terpinen-4-ol suppressed inflammatory mediator production by activating human monocytes (8).
A tea tree oil concentrate prevented influenza virus from entering the host cells by disturbing the normal viral membrane fusion procedure (25). Other in vitro studies indicate that tea tree oil has weak estrogenic and antiandrogenic properties that may alter the estrogen and androgen signaling pathways (13). At the same time, the notion that tea tree oil has hormone-modulating properties has been challenged, and further confirmatory research is needed (27).
Skin irritation following use of tea tree oil is due to its auto-oxidation and formation of epoxide intermediates via arene-epoxidation reactions catalyzed by human cytochrome P450 enzymes (17).",,"Tea tree | Melaleuca oil | Australian tea tree oil | Aceite del Árbol de Té, Australian Tea Tree Oil, Huile de Melaleuca, Huile de Théier, Huile de Théier Australien, Huile Essentielle de Théier, Melaleuca alternifolia, Melaleuca Essential Oil, Melaleuca Oil, Oil of Melaleuca, Oleum Melaleucae, Tea Tree, Tea Tree Essential Oil,Ti Tree Oil.",,Tea Tree Oil,Tea Tree Oil,Tea Tree Oil

DSI007714,Zeolite,,"Zeolites are a group of chemically related mineral substances that contain mainly hydrated aluminum and silicon compounds. They occur naturally in volcanic rock and ashes and are also formulated synthetically. Zeolites are marketed as dietary supplements for autism, diarrhea, herpes, hangover, to balance body pH, and as a heavy-metal detoxifier, immunomodulator, and antioxidant. Industrial and agricultural applications include their use as additives in gravel, detergents, and animal feed, in water and air purifiers, and in some personal care products. Benefits of using zeolites in animal feed include increased mineral utilization , reduction of heavy metals-induced anemia , and reduction of aflatoxin toxicity . However, none of these benefits are applicable to humans. In addition, this use has raised concerns about accumulated tissue aluminum in treated livestock vis-a-vis the known link of aluminum to several morbidities including Alzheimer’s disease . Generally, the various forms of zeolite are not significantly toxic in acute, short-term oral, or parenteral toxicity studies in animals. However, inhalation toxicity is readily demonstrated , and erionite, a type of airborne fibrous zeolite, has been associated with high incidence of malignant mesothelioma , and geologic occurrences of erionite are emerging as a concern for respiratory illness in the United States. Zeolites have limited use in medicine as an external hemostatic dressing for trauma-related injuries , potential for controlled drug delivery, as a suspending agent, or for use in cardiopulmonary bypass and hemodialysis procedures . A small pilot study sponsored by the manufacturer of a proprietary oral zeolite supplement in immunodeficient patients suggests some immunomodulatory effects , and zeolite formulations reduced symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome and decreased fracture risk in osteoporotic patients . In an Alzheimer’s mouse model, zeolite reduced oxidative damage and plaque generation . Animal studies suggest that micronized zeolite may have anticancer benefits ; and ameliorates malignant mesothelioma caused by asbestos toxicity . Preliminary data suggest benefits of zeolite formulations, used as adjuncts to standard treatment, in reducing symptoms of neuroendocrine tumor-related diarrhea ; and chemo-induced peripheral neuropathy . Special Point: A company filed a U.S. patent application in 2001 for a synthesized form of zeolite as a cancer drug . Data submitted were based on in vitro, plant, and animal studies. The patent specified that the substance must be injected directly into the tumor, which rules out any benefits by oral route.",,"Zeolites are hygroscopic compounds with a fine porous cage-like structure that allows for its ion-exchanging, adsorbent, anticaking, chelating, and desiccant characteristics (22) (23). Its ion-exchanging properties may alter the ionic composition, pH and buffering capacity of the gastrointestinal tract under conditions of overexposure (22).
Zeolite controls bleeding by absorbing water from the hemorrhage site through an exothermic reaction which supports the concentration of coagulation factors and platelets, causing clot formation (12). Zeolite pH buffering effects also adsorb nitrosamines in acidic solution (24), leading to unsubstantiated claims that it could remove carcinogenic substances in the stomach.
In vitro studies indicate that micronized zeolite inhibits protein kinase B, induces expression of tumor suppressor proteins (19), and limits reactive oxygen species effects (15). In animal studies, it reduced metastasis and increased the effect of doxorubicin due to its antioxidant properties (18). Zeolites may also have both immunosuppressive and immunostimulating effects, causing a decline of GM-CFU in the bone marrow (25), but also increasing graft-versus-host (GvH) reaction (26). Zeolite can affect brain serotonergic receptor activities of mammary carcinoma-bearing mice (27), but the clinical implications for humans is unclear. Zeolite supplementation did not prolong survival in tumor-bearing animals (25).",,Clinoptilolite | Erionite | Phillipsite | Mordenite,,Zeolite,Zeolite,

Although no survival improvements were reported with an agaricus extract in multiple myeloma patients, immunomodulatory effects were observed . However, agaricus extract did not confer any benefits in elderly women . Larger studies are needed to resolve the ambiguity. Whereas a small study reported that agaricus extract may improve liver function in patients with hepatitis B , liver damage and deaths along with cheilitis have been reported following consumption. In addition, laboratory samples of agaricus had high levels of inorganic arsenic . Brefeldin A, a compound isolated from agaricus, was shown to have estrogenic activity, but did not stimulate growth of breast cancer cells .",,"Agaricus extract was shown to exert estrogen-like activity and may help prevent atherosclerosis via dual roles in cell signaling, macrophage development suppression and endothelial cell recovery from vascular damage (16). Both aqueous and organic extracts of agaricus offered protection to cells exposed to methyl methanesulphonate, a mutagenic agent. The stimulus produced by linoleic acid on beta-DNA polymerase, an enzyme involved in repair mechanism following exposure of DNA to alkylating agents, is thought responsible for such an effect (19).
Ergosterol, a major constituent of agaricus, was found to inhibit tumor growth in mice via direct inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis (6). Other studies demonstrated that polysaccharides present in agaricus extract caused activation of macrophages (5) or natural killer cells (17) and induced cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity in tumor-bearing mice. Specifically, activation of natural killer cells was mediated through IL-12-induced IFN-gamma expression (18). Agaricus extract stimulates caspase 3 activation and reduces telomerase activity (19) possibly through regulation of Akt signaling (20) thereby inducing apoptosis in cancer cell lines. Blazeispirol A, produced by agaricus fermentation, causes both caspase-dependent and -independent cell death in human Hep 3B cells (21).

Oligosaccharides isolated from aloe extracts were found to prevent ultraviolet radiation-induced suppression of delayed type hypersensitivity by reducing keratinocyte-derived immunosuppressive cytokines (25). Proposed mechanism underlying anti-psoriatic effect includes inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)‑alpha‑induced proliferation of keratinocytes and overactivation of the nuclear factor (NF‑kappa B signaling pathway, by an aloe polysaccharide (40). And a polymer fraction of aloe was shown to protect the gastric mucosa against ethanol-induced gastric damage by decreasing mRNA expression levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9). The three enzymes are critical biomarkers in gastric ulceration (26). Other findings suggest that the radio-protective effects of aloe polysaccharides are most likely due to inhibition of apoptosis (27).
Emodin, an extract of Aloe vera, was shown to inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in human liver cancer cell lines through p53- and p21-dependent pathways (4). Acemannan, a carbohydrate fraction derived from Aloe vera leaf, was found to stimulate cytokine production in mouse macrophage cell line (5). It also exhibited immunomodulating activity by inducing maturation of dendritic cells (6).

DSI007812,Ayurveda,,"Derived from the Sanskrit words “ayur” (life) and “veda” (knowledge), Ayurveda originated in India over 3,000 years ago. Treatment is patient-tailored and consists of oral formulations containing herbal, mineral, spice, and animal components, purgatives, dietary and lifestyle changes, and improving mental balance through yoga or meditation. It is available in a few clinics in North America, but there is no licensure for practicing Ayurveda in the United States. Ayurvedic medicinals, which can contain from a few to hundreds of components, are commonly used to treat chronic diseases such as diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, acne, obesity, and cancer. Studies in humans are quite limited, perhaps in part due to the individualized nature of Ayurveda treatment. Preliminary data suggest some benefit of various Ayurvedic formulations for diabetes . In an equivalence study, pain reductions and improved function with either of two traditional ayurvedic formulations were comparable to glucosamine and celecoxib for knee osteoarthritis . However, additional safety studies are needed. Other preliminary data suggest that an individualized Ayurvedic treatment may be as effective as methotrexate against rheumatoid arthritis . A clinical trial of guggulipid for hyperlipidemia found it may actually raise cholesterol levels . A few Ayurvedic herbs are being investigated for their anticancer potential. Curcumin is among the most extensively studied, but positive findings are preliminary. Lifestyle changes and mind-body modalities are also a core component of Ayurveda. Yoga has been shown to improve sleep, mood, and quality of life, and reduce stress in cancer patients both during treatment and throughout survivorship. The effects of meditation in reducing anxiety, lowering blood pressure, and enhancing well-being both in the general population and in oncology settings have also been confirmed.",,"Ayurveda emphasizes both health maintenance (Svasthavritha), and diagnosis and treatment (Athuravritha). Patients are classified by their prominent dosha, or physical, emotional, and metabolic type, Kapha, Pitta, or Vata, each located in specific organs and associated with two of the five elements (earth, fire, water, air, and ether) and five senses. The doshas represent properties shared by the organs, body, environment, and cosmos. When a patient’s unique state of dosha is out of balance, illness occurs. Therapy is personalized to the individual’s problems and metabolic characteristics to restore balance through diet and lifestyle modifications, medicinals (herbs, spices, metals and/or animal products), breathing exercises, and meditation. Detoxification (panchakarma) occurs before administration of medicines, which includes bloodletting, induced vomiting, and bowel purging. The therapeutic approach seeks to cure disease by reversing the steps that led to it (eg, administering cooling medicines if Pitta, the hot dosha, is predominant) (10).
Maharasnadi Quathar, a medicinal used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, increases antioxidant enzyme activity, decreases TBARS generation, and improves symptoms in human subjects (16). Many of the frequently used herbs, such as ashwagandha (Withania somnifera), guggul (Commiphora mukul), Boswellia (Boswellia serrata), gotu kola (Centella asiatica), curcumin (Curcuma longa), ginger (Zingiber officinale), aloe (Aloe barbadensis), and garlic (Allium sativum), have been studied extensively in vitro and in vivo, and show antioxidant, antitumor, antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, or anti-inflammatory properties. Herbs often used to treat diabetes, Gymnema sylvestre, Momordica charantia, fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum), Coccinia indica, and Pterocarpus marsupium, show hypoglycemic activity in vitro and in vivo. Mucuna pruriens, used in preparations for Parkinson’s disease, contains L-dopa (17). Rasayana herbs, such as ashwagandha, Asparagus racemosus, Emblica officinalis, Piper longum, and Terminalia chebula that are said to promote positive health showed immunostimulant and adaptogenic activities in an animal study (18).

However, controlled trials are needed to confirm this observation.",,"In an erythroleukemic cell line, beta-elemene inhibited telomerase activity, which was enhanced in combination with cyclophosphamide (9). It also demonstrated anti-fibrotic effects, inducing decreases in plasma angiotensin II levels and angiotensin II receptor type 1 expression, reducing collagen formation in a liver fibrosis rat model (10). Beta-elemene also exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, with reduction in LPS-induced nitric oxide production and prostaglandin E2 by rat peritoneal macrophages (11).Beta-elemene has been shown to affect cancer cells via different mechanisms. In an in vitro study, following administration of beta-elemene, leukemia cells were arrested in S/G2 phase and underwent apoptosis (2). The antiproliferative effects were dependent on p38 MAPK activation/phosphorylation, cell cycle arrest in G0/G1, and inhibition of tumor growth of glioblastoma cells (3). Beta-elemene also induced G2/M arrest in lung carcinoma cells and ovarian cancer cells by combined reduction of cell-cycle promoters Cdc2 and cyclin B1, and elevated cell cycle regulators p53 and p27 (4) (5). Derivatives of beta-elemene showed antiproliferative activity in human cervical carcinoma cells through a decrease in cell cycle protein Cyclin D1 and thus cell cycle suppression (14). Furthermore, beta-elemene may enhance the effects of chemotherapy and radiation. In non-small cell lung cancer cells, apoptosis was induced by increased expression of Bax and p-Bcl-2, decreased Bcl-2 and XIAP, and augmented cisplatin-induced increases in caspase activity (6). In another study, apoptosis response to the taxanes paclitaxel and docetaxel in lung carcinoma cells was enhanced with beta-elemene, through increases in cytochrome c, caspase activity, downregulation of Bcl-2, and altered cell membrane permeability (7). Beta-elemene combined with radiation induced apoptosis in lung adenocarcinoma cells, possibly by sensitizing cancer cells to radiation (8).An in vivo study showed that beta-elemene inhibits growth of lung cancer cells, and up-regulates the expression of the tumor suppressor, P53, and the release of exosome (22). Another proposed mechanism is that beta-elemene reverses the resistance of lung cancer cells to cisplatin via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway (23).",Rhizoma zedoariae (E Zhu)Curcuma aromatica (Wenyujin),"

Electrodermal testing was developed as an aid in prescribing homeopathic remedies. Medicines are tested “to determine how well they resonate with the individual or how similar they are to the body frequencies needing enhancement to overcome an illness.” Practitioners claim the wave emission from homeopathic medicines or allergens is measured through the device and is modulated through the patient’s autonomic nervous system, influencing skin resistance (4) (6). No evidence supports any of these claims.
Some proponents claim the device naturally kills tumor cells by releasing “suppressed” tumor suppressor genes or attenuating overactive oncogenes. This hypothesis is untenable because of the irreversibility of most cancer-causing genetic mutations. An evaluation of one device found that a galvanic skin response of low resistance was not a reliable indicator of vertebral pathology, and that the device produced a low-resistance reading after 5 seconds of application to any point on the body (7) (8).",,Electrodermal testing | Bio-physical information therapy | BIT; Bio-energetic therapy; Energy medicine | Vibrational medicine,,,BioResonance Therapy,

DSI007817,Diet,C3668949,"Developed by Dr. Johanna Budwig in the 1950s, the Budwig diet is an unproven cancer treatment involving consumption of multiple daily servings of flaxseed oil and cottage cheese as well as vegetables, fruits, and juices. It prohibits intake of sugar, animal fats, shellfish, processed foods, soy, and most dairy products. It also encourages daily sunbathing and is often combined with coffee enemas. Budwig believed that cancer was caused by the lack of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and that a combination of flax oil and cottage cheese would improve cellular function. Although she wrote books and papers to provide anecdotal evidence and biochemical mechanisms of the diet, clinical trials have not been published in any peer-reviewed medical journal. Polyunsaturated fatty acids such as omega-3 found in flaxseeds have been shown to exert anticancer activities , but there is no evidence that such a diet has any benefit in preventing or treating cancer in humans.

Olive oil, a monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), comprises 15% to 20% as the major source of dietary fats in this diet . Another hallmark is the low consumption of meat and dairy products . The Mediterranean lifestyle also emphasizes social connection by sharing meals with family and friends. Epidemiological analyses suggest that over 90% of type 2 diabetes, 80% of coronary heart disease, and 70% of stroke can be avoided by adopting healthful food choices that model the traditional Mediterranean diet . In addition, large prospective studies have found the Mediterranean diet reduces hip fracture incidence , risk of cardiovascular events and gastrointestinal cancers , overall cancer risk , and preserves kidney function in coronary heart disease patients . When compared to a specific carbohydrate diet, Mediterranean diet may also confer greater benefit in patients with Crohn’s disease with mild to moderate symptoms . Other studies suggest it can reduce systolic blood pressure, improve endothelial functioning , and protect against macular degeneration . As well, leisure-time physical activity along with the Mediterranean diet, both individually and when combined, lowered all-cause mortality in older adults . Adherence to Mediterranean diet, physical activity, smoking abstinence, sedentary behavior avoidance also lowered all-cause mortality in adults regardless of age or medication burden . Various meta-analyses have also confirmed that Mediterranean diet reduces the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases , overall mortality , and cancer as well as incidence of Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease . Taken together, data on the Mediterranean diet further underscores the importance of emphasizing fruits vegetables, legumes, healthy fats, and whole grains. Cancer patients may have special nutritional needs and should consult a dietician before changing diet. Alcohol consumption can increase the risk of certain cancers . Interestingly, certain factors that improved adherence to the Mediterranean diet included female sex, older age, and higher levels of physical activity, while poorer adherence was associated with males and obesity . | The Jenny Craig diet is a dieting program that involves a personal counselor, prepackaged food, and a diet plan. The program can be completed at home or by attending a physical Jenny Craig facility. The Jenny Craig diet is used for obesity and general weight loss.",The Jenny Craig diet is LIKELY SAFE when followed appropriately. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if the Jenny Craig diet is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. But there is no reason to expect safety issues as long as nutritional needs are met.,"Dr. Budwig developed the diet based on the hypothesis that cancer is caused by reduced uptake of oxygen by cell membranes in the absence of omega-3 fatty acids (O3FAs) such as linolenic acid (7). While metabolic changes such as increased aerobic glycolysis and fatty acid synthesis occur in cancerous cells, (8) the role of O3FAs in the pathogenesis or cancer treatment is still under investigation (2). Polyunsaturated O3FAs in flaxseed oil have been shown to decrease levels of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta (9). O3FAs also demonstrated antineoplastic properties by increasing intracellular ROS and decreasing protumorigenic prostaglandins (2). Flax oil supplements increased total phospholipid fatty acid content in erythrocytes  (10), but the implication of this finding in cancer treatment is unknown. Flaxseed supplements also inhibited in vitro proliferation of human prostate (11) and breast cancer growth by downregulating growth factors and increasing p53 expression (12). Whole flaxseed contains lignans, phytoestrogens that may also have antineoplastic properties and exert hormonal effects (13).
Budwig believed that combining cottage cheese and flaxseed oil improved availability of essential fatty acids through the plasma membrane, thereby improving aerobic cellular respiration (1). The effect of cottage cheese consumption on the bioavailability of O3FAs has not been studied. Processed fats, saturated fats, animal fats, processed foods, and sugar are prohibited in the Budwig diet because they are thought to interfere with oxygen uptake and cellular respiration. Epidemiological studies show that people who consume lactovegetarian diets have lower incidence of gastrointestinal cancer compared with non-vegetarians (14) (15), although these studies indicate association rather than causation.
Greater tumor regression was reported in mice treated with trastuzumab therapy plus flax oil compared with those treated with trastuzumab alone (16). | The health benefits of the diet are attributed to the synergistic interactions across nutrients, and not to a single nutrient (1). At the same time, specific activities have been identified to partly explain the cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory effects, including decreases in oxidative stress, inflammation, plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) concentrations, and tumor necrosis factor α (24) (25) . Greater polyphenol intake from lignans, flavonols, and hydroxybenzoic acids found in the Mediterranean diet may be associated with decreased cardiovascular disease risks (26). Extra virgin olive oil, which contains phenolic compounds, vitamin E, and other lipid molecules, also has antiatherogenic effects, improving endothelial function, lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and blood pressure levels (17) (27) (28).","Organic flaxseed combined with low-fat cottage cheese | A variety of fruits, vegetables, cereals, legumes, combined with poultry, fish, nuts, seeds, olive oil and moderate red wine intake with meals (1).","Budwig protocol | Flaxseed oil diet | Linseed oil diet | Flax oil and cottage cheese diet | Oil-protein diet | Cellect-Budwig protocol | Bill Henderson protocol |

DSI007818,CAAT,,"Controlled Amino Acid Therapy (CAAT) was developed by Angelo John of the A. P. John Institute for Cancer Research. It is a protocol that involves amino acid and carbohydrate deprivation. The objective of this therapy is to impair the development of cancer cells by altering cell formation through structure, energy, blood vessels, growth hormones and function. The regimen consists of a diet that restricts intake of carbohydrates and proteins, and involves the use of supplements. In addition, supplementation with Superoxide Dismutase, curcumin, parsley, quercetin, lycopene, Vitamin D and green tea extract is encouraged. (See individual monographs for more information about those supplements.) The protocol is meant to be maintained for six to nine months as an adjunct to conventional chemotherapy and radiation. Whereas the Institute’s now defunct website described studies that support the theories behind the protocol, no studies have been conducted to determine the safety or efficacy of the regimen itself.",,"According to its proponents, CAAT curbs the growth of cancer cells by impairing a number of factors essential to their growth. Restricting a cancer cell’s access to glycine is thought to limit its ability to replicate its DNA, build new blood vessels, and create growth factors and other hormones essential for metastatic growth. Additionally, the low-carbohydrate diet is thought to inhibit glycolysis, the main mechanism for cancer cells to derive energy.",,Controlled Amino Acid Therapy,,,CAAT,
DSI007819,Calcium Glucarate,C0006698,"Calcium glucarate is the salt and commercial form of glucaric acid, which occurs naturally in a variety of foods including apples, oranges, broccoli, and spinach . Calcium glucarate and other derivatives have been used to prevent and treat cancer. Patients with breast cancer sometimes self-medicate with calcium glucarate supplements following surgery or adjunctive treatments. The glucarate component, not the calcium, is thought to account for its activity. Following administration, glucarate is converted to D-glucaro-1,4-lactone, which inhibits beta-glucuronidase . In vitro and animal studies suggest inhibition of beta-glucuronidase may prevent carcinogenesis , as well as initiation and promotion of cancer cells . Increased elimination of carcinogens and hormones including estrogen has also been shown . In colon and lung cancer models, calcium glucarate exerted chemopreventive effects in the post-initiation phase of carcinogenesis. Dietary calcium glucarate also inhibited oral carcinogenesis . Topical calcium glucarate suppressed tumor development in murine skin tumors , and enhanced chemopreventive effects were achieved with a topical butyric acid, nicotinamide, and calcium glucarate combination . Other preclinical data suggest topical ursolic acid along with dietary calcium glucarate supplementation could also reduce skin tumor promotion and inflammatory signaling . Preliminary findings from a human study suggest that low glucaric acid levels and/or high beta-glucuronidase levels are markers of detoxification system impairment, and that calcium glucarate supplementation might reduce the cancer risk of some individuals . Subsequent studies have not materialized and are needed to confirm such effects. | Calcium D-glucarate is a chemical similar to glucaric acid. Glucaric acid is naturally found in the body and in some fruits and vegetables. Calcium D-glucarate is made by combining glucaric acid with calcium. Calcium D-glucarate might lower estrogen levels, which might have effects in some people with hormone-dependent cancers. People use calcium D-glucarate for preventing breast cancer, prostate cancer, and colon cancer, and for treating other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Don't confuse calcium D-glucarate with calcium. These are not the same.",When taken by mouth : There isn't enough reliable information to know if calcium D-glucarate is safe or what the side effects might be. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if calcium D-glucarate is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use.,"The glucarate component, not the calcium, accounts for the activity of calcium glucarate, which is absorbed from the gut as D-glucaric acid. This is further converted to D-glucaro-1,4-lactone, which is thought to inhibit beta-glucuronidase activity (4). Beta-glucuronidase has been shown to decrease the rate of elimination of estrogen and carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nitrosamines by deconjugation (3). Inhibition of beta-glucuronidase activity with calcium glucarate improves excretion of metabolized estrogen and carcinogens (2). D-glucarate can also be metabolized by gut bacteria, inhibit bacterial beta-glucuronidase, and potentially alter the enterohepatic cycle.
In animal studies, calcium glucarate reduced the quantity of benzo[a]pyrene-induced lung lesions with mutated K-ras and p53 genes in the post-initiation phase via DNA adduct removal, mutagenic suppression, and anti-inflammatory activity (8). Antitumorigenic effects of topical calcium glucarate may be due to stimulated differentiation via induction of transglutaminase activity and suppression of proliferation (6), as well as inhibition of thymidine kinase and aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activities, thus preventing carcinogen-DNA binding (10). Enhanced chemopreventive effects by a topical butyric acid, nicotinamide, and calcium glucarate combination used on murine skin tumors occurred via induced mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, upregulated p21, and downregulated Bcl-2, mut p53 (12). In another study this combination regulated miR-203 status through epigenetic or biogenetic modulations before and after tumor development to a greater degree than each of the individual compounds (13). Reduced epidermal hyperplasia with a combination of topical ursolic acid and dietary calcium glucarate supplementation caused a marked decrease in COX-2 and IL-6 expression (14).
In a preliminary human study, calcium glucarate supplementation suppressed beta-glucuronidase levels while increasing serum glucaric acid levels (15).","Cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage, and Brussels sprouts; oranges, grapefruit, apples, spinach, carrots, potatoes, lettuce, bean sprouts, grapes (1) (4) (16)","Glucarate | Calcium-D-glucarate | Calcium saccharate | Calcium-D-saccharate | Calcio D-Glucarato, Calcium-D Glucarate, Calcium-D-Glucarate, Calcium D-Saccharate, Calcium Glucarate, D-Glucarate (GA), D-Glucaric Acid Calcium Salt, D-Saccharic Acid Calcium Salt, Glucarate de Calcium.",,,Calcium Glucarate,Calcium D-Glucarate

Cesium chloride, a non-radioactive salt, is promoted as an alternative cancer treatment. Also known as “high pH therapy,” it is based on findings that cancer cells have an affinity for cesium ions . Proponents claim that elevated cellular pH following cesium uptake prevents cancer cell division and neutralizes toxins, but there are no data to substantiate these claims. In a case series, only half of patients with terminal cancer who used a cesium-based regimen survived after 1 year, and one-quarter died within the first 2 weeks, suggesting the treatment is highly toxic . Reported adverse effects of cesium chloride intake include syncope, hypokalemia, diarrhea, and ventricular tachycardia with prolonged QT interval .",,Proponents of cesium chloride therapy claim that it exerts antitumor effects by increasing the intracellular pH of tumor cells. The resulting alkaline environment is thought to prevent cancer cells from undergoing mitosis eventually resulting in cell death. Cesium causes hypokalemia by inhibiting potassium channels used for absorption of dietary potassium and for re-absorption of renal potassium.

DSI007828,Di Bella Multitherapy,,"Di Bella multitherapy, a questionable alternative therapy, consists of somatostatin, melatonin, bromocriptine, a solution of retinoids, and low doses of cyclophosphamide or hydroxyurea. Physiologist Luigi Di Bella developed the regimen and promotes it as an effective treatment for cancer, retinitis pigmentosa, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Alzheimer’s disease. Treatment is tailored to the individual patient, and purportedly stimulates the body’s self-healing without the toxicity of conventional chemotherapy. Di Bella multitherapy is based on the theory that growth hormone (GH) and prolactin are involved in neoplastic growth. Somatostatin and its analog octreotide inhibit the secretion of GH and IGF-1 in humans , while bromocriptine is a prolactin inhibitor . This treatment was very popular in Italy in the late 1990s as Di Bella claimed he cured thousands on an outpatient basis and physicians in other countries such as Canada also prescribed it. The treatment was also highly publicized and politicized in Italy, raising the issue of “freedom of treatment” for patients who could not afford the expensive regimen. In response, local judges ordered that somatostatin be added to the list of effective reimbursable medications , and the Italian National Institute of Health supported 11 separate open-label uncontrolled phase II studies of 8 different cancers, organized by Di Bella and the National Cancer Advisory Committee . These trials found no complete responses , 0.8% partial response rate, and considerable toxicity . However, in uncontrolled studies 20 patients with late stage non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma had a 70% response rate , and 15 patients with osteosarcoma had improved survival and quality of life with similar regimens. Adverse effects include increased pain at tumor site, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, and somnolence . Somatostatin may reduce or eliminate the efficacy of painkillers such as methadone and morphine .",,"The Di Bella Multitherapy is based on the theory that growth hormone (GH) and prolactin are involved in neoplastic growth, particularly in lymphomas and leukemias. The following components have been studied, but their combined activities and at the Di Bella doses are unknown.
Somatostatin inhibits growth hormone (GH) secretion. Its synthetic analog, octreotide, shows antineoplastic activity in vitro and in vivo, and is used clinically for the treatment of acromegaly and neuroendocrine tumors. Their biological effects are mediated via high affinity plasma membrane receptors that are found throughout the body and on many human tumors. Clinical studies show a reduction in serum IGF-1 and IGF-1 gene expression after treatment with octreotide (1). Somatostatin and analogs also enhance secretion and expression of IGF-binding protein-1, which negatively regulates plasma IGF-1, while inhibiting mitogens and secretion of gastrointestinal hormones implicated in tumor growth. Somatostatin analogs also show immune-modulating activity in vitro and inhibit angiogenesis and directly induce cell growth arrest and apoptosis in vivo and in vitro (7).Melatonin is a free-radical scavenger and displays anti-proliferative effects on various cancer cell lines in vitro, but no human studies show evidence of anti-tumor activity. Melatonin shows antimyelodysplastic activity and reduces bone marrow toxicity of chemotherapeutic agents in animal models. See melatonin for additional information (2) (3) (4) (5).Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist and prolactin inhibitor. Prolactin stimulates growth of lymphomas in vivo and in vitro, and prolactin receptors are present on normal and neoplastic lymphoid cells.
Retinoids act as antioxidants and immunostimulants, cause cell growth arrest in B-cell lymphomas in vitro, and have shown benefit in trials of promyelotic leukemia and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

Gerson’s rationale is that cancer patients have low immunity and generalized tissue damage characterized by decreased intracellular potassium to sodium (K/Na) ratios, and, when their cancer is destroyed, toxic degradation products cause coma and death. His diet increases potassium intake and minimizes sodium consumption in an effort to correct the electrolyte imbalance, repair tissue, and detoxify the liver, while coffee enemas reportedly cause dilation of bile ducts and excretion of toxic breakdown products by the liver and through the colon wall. Supplemental potassium and oxidizing thyroid enzymes are given to introduce oxidation to cancer cells and kill them. None of these claims has been substantiated by scientific research (4) (6).
This regimen has resulted in coma-inducing low levels of sodium. Case reports of deaths from repeated administration of coffee enemas indicate that the practice causes a dangerous decrease in serum electrolytes. Coffee enemas have an osmolality of 62 mOsm/kg; repeated administration increases extravascular fluid volume and may cause electrolyte imbalances and subsequent death (5).
The ease of absorption of the high volumes of raw fruit and vegetables in this diet is questionable, especially in patients with GI cancers or chemotherapy-induced mucosal damage. While elements of the Gerson diet are similar to diet recommendations made by the USDA and the American Cancer Society, metabolic diets are unsuitable for some patients with disseminated or metastatic disease, particularly of the head, neck, and gut (1).",,Gerson diet; Gerson therapy | Gerson method; Gerson program | Gerson treatment; Gerson Institute,,,Gerson Regimen,
DSI007832,Glyconutrients,,"Glyconutrients refer to 8 plant monosaccharides: galactose, glucose, arabinose, glucosamine, mannose, xylose, rhamnose, and fucose. Related products are mostly marketed by a company called Mannatech under the brand name Ambrotose. Proponents claim that these monosaccharides are essential for the body because they are building blocks of glycoproteins which are used for cell-to-cell communication. They also suggest that the modern diet is deficient in monosaccharides and that supplementation can restore cellular health and support the immune system . However, strong scientific evidence to support these claims is lacking. Glyconutrients are also promoted to cancer patients through network marketing approaches, but their benefit is unclear. | Glyconutrients are plant sugars linked in chains. The body breaks down these sugar chains into simple sugars. The most commonly used glyconutrients contain plant sugars from aloe and larch arabinogalactan. People use these sugars to make medicine. Glyconutrients  are used for alcoholism, allergy, asthma, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.","When taken by mouth : Glyconutrients are POSSIBLY SAFE when taken in doses of about 2-4 grams daily for 8-12 weeks. They can cause intestinal gas and bloating. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if glyconutrients are safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding. Stay on the safe side and avoid use. ""Auto-immune diseases"" such as multiple sclerosis (MS), lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus, SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), or other conditions : Glyconutrients might cause the immune system to become more active. This might increase the symptoms of auto-immune diseases. If you have an auto-immune condition, it's best to avoid using glyconutrients as medicine until more is known.","Although sugars such as glucose are essential for normal functioning of the body, true deficiencies are rare except in malnourished patients. Humans can convert saccharides into different forms according to the body’s needs. More complex polysaccharides, such as beta-glucan, have been studied for their immunomodulating effects, but it is unclear if the marketed products contain substantial amounts of such polysaccharides.
Even though some of the constituents have been investigated for their anticancer effects, none of them have been shown to be effective for cancer treatment. In a trial sponsored by Mannatech, Ambrotose was shown to enhance brain wave activities when compared to placebo. However, the clinical implication remains to be determined (2).",,"

DSI007833,HMB,,"Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate (HMB) is a metabolite of the amino acid leucine. It is often used as a body building supplement to help improve muscle strength by reducing protein breakdown. HMB is also added to some medical foods for patients with muscle wasting and cachexia. Small studies were initially conducted in active and younger men with mixed results on body composition and physical performance . A systematic review suggests that HMB may prevent exercise-related muscle damage in healthy trained and untrained individuals, as well as muscle loss during chronic disease . However, research on HMB in clinical populations is limited. Some studies in the elderly suggest HMB benefits vascular endothelial function , reduces muscle breakdown , decreases abdominal fat mass , improves functional recovery after hip fracture , and reduces mortality . Other small studies suggest HMB may improve pulmonary function in COPD patients and nitrogen balance in critically injured patients , but it did not reduce comorbidities in hemodialysis patients . Very few studies have been conducted in cancer populations. One small study suggests an HMB-containing supplement may help prevent radiation dermatitis in head and neck cancer patients . HMB is often used together with glutamine and arginine for muscle wasting and cachexia , but a larger randomized trial failed to demonstrate a significant effect . Meta-analyses suggest HMB may help increase muscle and strength in various clinical conditions, but the effect size was small , and little to no impact was seen when HMB supplementation was added to exercise in the elderly . The upcoming HEAL study may help elucidate any true effects of HMB in frail older adults .",,"HMB is metabolized from the branched chain amino acid L-leucine endogenously through alpha-ketoisocaproic acid. Since only a small amount is converted from food sources, supplementation is used to increase intake. As a dietary supplement, HMB usually comes in calcium salt or free acid forms, the latter which is thought to have higher bioavailability (21). In muscle cells, HMB stimulates cell growth and survival through MAPK/ERK pathways (22). HMB restored balance between intracellular protein synthesis and breakdown by activating PI3K/Akt-dependent mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (23) (24). The stimulating effect of HMB on mTOR is eliminated with the introduction of rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor (6) (25). However, it is unclear if HMB supplementation would also reduce the therapeutic effects of other mTOR inhibitors used in cancer treatment. HMB inhibits the ubiquitin-proteasome proteolytic pathway which governs the degradation of intracellular proteins (26) . In murine neuroblastoma cells, HMB exihibited neurotrophic effects (27).

DSI007834,Homeopathy,,"Homeopathy is a medical system developed 200 years ago by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann, a German physician. Promoted as a safer and more holistic approach to treating disease, it has remained especially popular in India and some European countries. Homeopathic remedies are highly diluted forms of botanical, animal, or mineral substances which when given in full strength to a healthy volunteer, cause the presenting symptoms of the patient. Opponents argue that the benefits experienced by patients are merely placebo effects , which are no larger than those observed in conventional medicine . In a US national survey, homeopathy was most commonly used for respiratory and otorhinolaryngology complaints . Observational studies suggest that certain homeopathic products can provide long-term relief from symptoms such as headache and allergic rhinitis in adults, and atopic dermatitis and recurrent infections in children . One study suggests benefit with an add-on homeopathic preparation for recurrent tonsillitis . However, adjuvant homeopathy was not helpful for otitis media with effusion , and systematic reviews found data on homeopathy for otitis media or chronic rhinosinusitis to be scant and of limited quality . Higher quality trials also do not support the use of homeopathic remedies for pediatric respiratory tract infections . Only a few studies have been conducted in psychological symptoms and are largely negative. An epidemiological study found only marginal improvement for anxiety and depression among those who consulted practitioners prescribing homeopathy versus conventional care , and another study on homeopathy for depression was terminated early due to recruitment difficulties . In addition, meta-analyses have determined that evidence on homeopathy for ADHD symptoms or psychiatric disorders is lacking , and The European Sleep Research Society does not recommend homeopathy for insomnia . Studies of homeopathy in cancer patients are limited. Various homeopathic care regimens adjunctive to cancer therapy appeared to improve global health status and wellbeing , fatigue , quality of life , and acute radiodermatitis , but not chemotherapy-induced emesis or endocrine therapy-related hot flushes . Other case reports suggest homeopathic remedies may be helpful for advanced cancer or post-treatment breast cancer pain , and a few in vitro studies suggest some homeopathic ingredients may have anticancer effects . However, these observations have not been evaluated in clinical trials and cancer patients should be aware that homeopathy is not a substitute for mainstream care. Unlike remedies used in classical homeopathy, some contemporary homeopathic products may actually contain ingredients in allopathic doses, which has raised concerns about potential adverse effects or drug interactions . In a meta-analysis, the rate of adverse effects from homeopathy was similar to studies that randomized patients to placebo and conventional medicine . The Canadian Paediatric Society states that particular homeopathic treatments called nosodes have not been proven effective against infectious disease and are not alternatives to vaccinations . In addition, homeopathic teething products have been associated with harm in infants, and some researchers recommend against homeopathic remedies in general to treat pediatric conditions .",,"The practice of homeopathy is governed by the Law of Similars: Similia similibus curanturor or “like cures like.” Hahnemann and his followers observed that while certain plants, animals or minerals could cause specific symptoms when ingested by healthy individuals, the highly diluted form of the same substance could relieve similar symptoms in ailing patients. Other principles include tailored treatment so that different people with the same condition may receive different regimens, and the “law of minimum dose” — the idea that a lower dose translates to greater effectiveness (38).
An in vitro study showed that an antidiabetic product commonly used in homeopathy demonstrated anticancer effects by inducing nuclear DNA fragmentation and increasing levels of mRNA expression of apoptotic signal related genes cytochrome c and caspase 3, and by reducing expression of antiapoptotic gene Bcl2 (5). Another product, Phytolacca decandra, exerted anticancer properties in melanoma cells via activation of caspase-mediated signaling and ROS generation (6). However, it is not known if these products will have the same effects when diluted according to homeopathic principles.
Several challenges endure with evaluating the efficacy of homeopathy, including obtaining adequate documentation from traditional practitioners (38), and its plausibility against known pharmacology principles (39).",,Homeopathic medicine | Homeopathic remedy,,,Homeopathy,
DSI007835,Hoxsey Herbal Therapy,,"Hoxsey Herbal Therapy is an alternative therapy that consists of herbal tonics and restrictive diets, and is promoted as a cancer cure. It is illegal in the United States, but has been available at clinics in Tijuana, Mexico. According to the inventor Harry Hoxsey, the principal “brown” tonic contains potassium iodide, licorice, red clover, burdock root, stillingia root, barberry, cascara, pokeweed, prickly ash bark, and buckthorn bark. The diet involves eliminating pork, vinegar, tomatoes, pickles, carbonated drinks, alcohol, bleached flour, sugar and salt, and emphasizes iron, calcium, vitamin C, yeast supplements and grape juice. Hoxsey claims the treatment detoxifies the body, strengthens the immune system, balances body chemistry, and allows the body to digest and excrete tumors. Superoxide dismutase, vitamin B12, Gerovital (a mixture of procaine hydrochloride and vitamins), “Prolobin liver,” TST-100, rosette cactus, Koch Antitoxins, BCG vaccine, and Shulte’s medications sometimes are included in the regimen. Hoxsey was convicted many times for practicing medicine without a license. The U.S. government reported that the 400 patients Hoxsey claimed to have cured never had cancer, were cured before receiving his treatment, still had cancer, or had died from the disease . The National Cancer Institute evaluated 77 case reports submitted by Hoxsey and concluded that none showed efficacy . No clinical data support the value of this therapy. The American Cancer Society strongly urges cancer patients not to use the Hoxsey treatment, as no objective evidence exists to support its efficacy .",,"Hoxsey claims that the internal formulation “stimulates the elimination of toxins that poison the system, thereby correcting the abnormal blood chemistry and normalizing cell metabolism.” His head nurse added that it restores acid/base balance, normal metabolism, and immune function, and “deals with the DNA.” None of these claims is substantiated by scientific data. The herbal tonic was developed by Hoxsey’s great grandfather, whose horse was reportedly cured of a leg tumor after eating wild herbs. Hoxsey combined these herbs with home remedies to create the “brown” tonic. In vitro and animal studies conducted with individual components (e.g., licorice, red clover, burdock, pokeroot, stillingia, barberry - see individual monographs) indicate possible anti-tumor and immunostimulant properties, but their concentrations and activity in the tonic have not been determined (1) (2).",,Hoxsey herbs | Hoxsey formula | Hoxsey method,,,Hoxsey Herbal Therapy,

In vitro and animal studies indicate anti-inflammatory , antitumor , antiangiogenic , and neuroprotective effects. Indirubin also inhibits cyclin-dependent kinases in tumor cells . A derivative of indirubin enhanced the cytotoxic effects of adriamycin . Studies of indirubin in humans are limited. A few clinical trials suggest topical I. naturalis ointment is effective for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis . Oral I. naturalis induced a clinical response in ulcerative colitis , but the trial was stopped due to a prior case of pulmonary arterial hypertension, possibly related to a self-purchased product . In addition, a subsequent national survey in Japan identified 11 cases of PAH in UC patients as well as other adverse events . Short-term indigo administration in patients with mild to moderate UC appeared to be effective without serious adverse events, but the study was small and additional research is needed . In patients with Crohn’s disease, preliminary analyses suggest only modest benefit . Interim trial analysis of oral chemotherapy with an I. naturalis formulation versus intravenous chemotherapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia suggests it is as effective and may reduce hospital stays , but the final analysis has yet to be published. A small study of indirubin in the form of indigowood root powder for patients with head and neck cancer found a reduction in mucosal damage from radiation therapy .

In human skin samples, indirubin produced anti-psoriatic effects by modulating proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes (10).
Anticancer and neuroprotective properties are attributed to inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 by competing with ATP binding sites (31). Indirubin-3-oxime inhibits growth of human laryngeal cancer cells via CDK inhibitor p21, cyclin D1 inhibition, and caspase-3 activation (1).

The regimen was based on the theory that cancer was caused by the bacterium Progenitor cryptocides, which developer Virginia Livingston-Wheeler reported to have isolated in a wide variety of cancer tissues . A weakened immune system would then allow the bacterium to grow, and consequently the therapy’s focus was immune-stimulation. Although a number of viruses and bacteria have been associated with various cancers , a link between the bacteria named by Livingston-Wheeler and cancer was never confirmed by independent researchers. A self-selected, matched-cohort, prospective comparison of patients at Livingston-Wheeler Clinic and a conventional cancer center found no difference in survival times between groups, but did find consistently lower quality of life in the Livingston-Wheeler cohort .

According to a systematic review, MZRW is the most commonly used herbal formula for constipation in China , particularly by elderly patients and women . A population-based study reported it is also among the formulas commonly prescribed to prostate cancer patients in Taiwan . Much of available data of MZRW’s clinical effects are limited to Asian populations. In a three-armed randomized controlled trial involving patients with functional constipation, MZRW was found to be equally effective as senna, a popular herbal laxative, in increasing complete spontaneous bowel movement (CSBM). Compared to the senna and placebo groups, the MZRW arm also had a significant increase in colonic transit along with decreased severity in straining, constipation, incomplete evacuation, and global constipation symptoms. Benefits were also more durable in the MZRW group . Similar improvements have been reported in other randomized double-blind studies. Patients with functional constipation who took MZRW had increased CSBM and reductions in constipation severity and use of rescue therapy compared to the placebo group . In a pilot RCT for palliative cancer patients with constipation, modified MZRW was well-tolerated, increased in stool frequency, and reduced constipation severity and straining versus placebo . A systematic review and meta-analysis (17 trials, 1681 patients) concluded that MZRW is beneficial against functional constipation in Asian populations. In addition, MZRW did not increase adverse events compared to controls . Of note, four studies in this review involved pediatric and adult cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced and opioid-associated constipation.

DSI007843,Magnet Therapy,,"Magnet therapy is an alternative treatment available in clinics in Mexico, Germany, and elsewhere. It is promoted to diagnose and treat cancer, AIDS, psychiatric disorders, stress, multiple sclerosis, infections, and to increase energy, prolong life, and stimulate the immune system. Magnetic fields are administered by application of magnets to certain parts of the body, by magnetic field-generating machines, or with magnetic mattresses or blankets. Treatment can last minutes to weeks. Evidence supporting the use of magnetic therapies for the above conditions is limited. State consumer protection agencies and the FDA have prosecuted various marketers of magnetized devices and therapies, forcing them to halt unsubstantiated claims of health benefits. In vitro studies show that static magnetic fields may modulate ion transport and related cell and neuronal activity , but the physiological significance of these findings is unknown. No anticancer activity has been demonstrated. Patients also use magnetized braces and mattresses to treat pain associated with fibromyalgia, diabetic neuropathy, sciatica, and arthritis. Although small studies have reported improvements in pain associated with conditions such as diabetic neuropathy , fibromyalgia , and arthritis , results are often indistinguishable from placebo effects. Some preliminary findings suggest pulsed magnetic therapy may help alleviate paresthesia better than placebo in patients with multiple sclerosis , and reduce pain and disability in patients with back pain . Also, synchronized transcranial magnetic stimulation may be useful in patients with major depressive disorder , but these are specific technologies that are still being evaluated in clinical settings for potential safety and efficacy. Body magnets are contraindicated in radiology and/or magnetic resonance procedures. Patients with cardiac pacemakers and pregnant women should also avoid use of magnetic devices. Magnetic therapies have no role in the diagnosis or treatment of cancer.",,"Marketers make varying unsubstantiated claims for how magnets work, such as: magnets “act upon the body’s energy field,” or correct “magnetic field deficiency syndrome,” (1) a condition said to result from decreases in the earth’s magnetic field over the past 1,000 years. It is purported that the positive (south) pole of the magnet has a “stress effect,” which interferes with metabolic functioning, produces acidity, reduces cellular oxygen supply, and encourages the replication of latent microorganisms. The negative (north) pole is said to have a “calming effect” and helps to normalize metabolic functioning, promote oxygenation, and treat neurological/psychiatric disorders. No evidence supports these claims, and no anticancer activity is seen with magnetic fields in laboratory or human studies. Most anecdotes of magnetic “healing” involve symptoms that may be psychosomatic, associated with stress, or subjective measures such as pain or depression (3).
Theoretically, static magnetic fields (SMFs) may alter ion flow, cellular potential, membrane configuration, ion pump activity, or neurotransmitter release (4). Most of the biological phenomena associated with SMFs may be caused by changes in cellular calcium (8). SMFs of 1,000-4,000 G are found to alter protein and enzyme structure and the kinetics of reactions involving free radicals (7) (9). Reduced action potential firing in cultured neurons and permeability changes in synthetic liposome vesicles are observed after application of a SMF (5). It may not be legitimate to extrapolate in vitro data in which cells are directly exposed to magnetic fields, to their effect in a complex biological system. Moreover, many in vitro studies have not been replicated. Although some authors refer to documented effects of pulsed electromagnetic fields in attempting to explain a mechanism of action for static magnets, SMFs do not generate an electric field and therefore cannot confer the claimed physiologic effects (10). It is suggested that positive reports of magnet use reflect placebo effects.",,Biomagnetic therapy | Electromagnetic field therapy,,,Magnet Therapy,

DSI007846,Metabolic Therapies,,"As strict dietary and detoxification regimens promoted to prevent and treat cancer and degenerative diseases, metabolic therapies are based on the theory that these conditions are caused by an accumulation of toxic substances in the body. Advocates claim that a healthy diet and practices including coffee enemas, herbal laxatives, and immune augmentation detoxify the body and allow it to heal naturally. Therapies such as Gerson, Kelley, Contreras, Manner, and Gonzalez share this ideology but differ in modality. The diets are often based on whole foods including fresh fruits and vegetables, and are supplemented by digestive enzymes, glandular extracts, megadose vitamins, minerals, or herbal products. Agents such as hydrazine sulphate, hydrogen peroxide, or laetrile may also be administered. Retrospective reviews of the Gerson, Kelley, and Contreras therapies show no evidence of efficacy. Results from a study involving patients with inoperable pancreatic cancer showed a decrease in overall survival and poorer quality of life with proteolytic enzymes, often used to supplement a metabolic therapy diet, compared with standard gemcitabine-based chemotherapy . Although dietary remedies provide a strong sense of personal control, the strict recommendations of some metabolic therapies can cause nutritional deficiencies, while some entail potentially toxic doses of supplements or agents. Coffee enemas can cause sepsis, dangerous electrolyte deficiencies, and death. The American Cancer Society urges cancer patients not to seek treatment with metabolic therapies.",,"Advocates of metabolic therapies claim that cancer and other diseases result from an accumulation of toxins in the body from food additives, preservatives, pesticides, and industrial pollution that disrupt the immune system and cell metabolism. The removal of these toxins through bowel purging and a healthy diet, they claim, allows the body to heal naturally. While diet may play a role in cancer prevention and some cancers are associated with environmental exposures, strict dietary restrictions, as in the Gerson regimen, cause nutritional deficiencies.
Caffeine in coffee enemas is purported to cause dilation of bile ducts, bile production, glutathione S-transferase (GST) activation, and excretion of toxic breakdown products by the liver and through the colon wall. Kahweol and cafestol are constituents of green coffee that stimulate GST activation, but their activity is destroyed with roasting. Repeated administration of coffee enemas increases extravascular fluid volume and can cause serum electrolyte imbalances. Significant loss of bile salts associated with repeated long-term administration of enemas can result in malabsorption of fat, fat-soluble vitamins, and calcium (2) (3) (4).

Beta-lapachone downregulates cyclooxygenase (COX-2) and telomerase activities (1). It also induces apoptosis in cancer cells via mitochondrial signaling (2) or by activating caspases (5) (9) (2). The antimetastatic activity of beta-lapachone occurs by inducing Egr-1, known to suppress metastasis, thereby decreasing the invasive ability of cancer cells (4).

A methanolic extract of taheebo inhibited cell proliferation through the extracelluar signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2) mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (10).
Lapachol’s anticoagulant activity is due to the inhibition of vitamin K epoxide and quinone reductases, an action similar to that of warfarin (14).

DSI007856,Psilocybin,C0033850,"Psilocybin is an indole alkaloid found in more than 200 species of fungi commonly referred to as “magic mushrooms,” many of which belong to the genus Psilocybe. Historically used for religious ceremonies and healing rituals by Mesoamerican cultures, psilocybin mushrooms are ingested orally for their hallucinogenic effects. They are also brewed as teas or added to other foods to mask their bitter taste. Upon consumption, psilocybin is converted to psilocin, which has psychoactive properties. Psilocybin is a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act, but renewed interest in its therapeutic potential for treating mental health issues has led to a surge in clinical research in recent years. Randomized controlled trials have reported benefits of psilocybin-assisted therapy for Tobacco use disorder (1) Alcohol use disorder (2) Treatment-resistant depression (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) Systematic reviews/meta-analyses showed Improvements in end-of-life anxiety (9) Positive effects on existential and spiritual well-being, quality of life and acceptance in patients with terminal illness (10) Effectiveness comparable to escitalopram for long-standing depression (11) Preliminary findings also suggest beneficial effects in individuals with Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) (12) Cluster headaches (13) (14) Migraines (15) Demoralization with an AIDS diagnosis (16) In cancer patients with psychological distress, psilocybin affected Reductions in suicidal ideation (17) Rapid, significant, and sustained reductions in depression and anxiety (18) (19) (20) Notably, mystical experience – characterized by deep feelings of meaning/sacredness, interconnectedness, transcendence of time and space, and a strong positive mood – was positively correlated with reductions in depression (18). Microdosing: Consuming very low doses of psychedelics for improving mood, concentration, creativity, and cognitive function is also gaining popularity. Studies are mixed on whether microdosing can improve mood and mental health . A case series suggests it may relieve chronic neuropathic pain . Legal Status: Under federal law, the use, sale and possession of psilocybin is illegal. Given the promising preliminary data, the USFDA granted “breakthrough therapy” status to psilocybin in 2018 for treatment-resistant depression, and in 2019 for major depressive disorder. This designation can help minimize the burden of federal regulations that impede research and drug development. Many states are also moving toward decriminalizing psilocybin for therapeutic or recreational purposes: Oregon became the first to both decriminalize and legalize psilocybin for therapeutic use, with ballot initiatives underway in Colorado and California . The American Psychiatric Association supports research into psychedelics, but states that “clinical treatments should be determined by scientific evidence in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and not by ballot initiatives or popular opinion” . In Summary, emerging evidence suggests that psilocybin improves mental health outcomes in patients with multiple psychiatric conditions. With increasing public interest and acceptance of psychedelic therapies, larger trials with more diverse populations, standardized dosages, stronger blinding/controls, research on long-term effects, as well as clear regulations and guidelines are needed to inform future clinical practice . It is important to note that although psilocybin has low potential of addiction and is associated with lower risk of adverse effects compared to other psychoactive drugs such as LSD or MDMA, it can cause acute psychological distress, dangerous behavior and sustained psychological discomfort in uncontrolled environments . Individuals who abuse psilocybin mushrooms may also risk poisoning because their morphological similarities to some poisonous mushrooms could lead to misidentification. | Psilocybin is a psychedelic compound found in ""magic mushrooms"", often in the Psilocybe genus. It's used in spiritual rituals, recreationally, and as medicine. Psilocybin has hallucinogenic effects. It can be obtained from both fresh and dried mushrooms in varying concentrations. It can also be created in a lab. There's increased interest in using pure psilocybin for addictions, depression, and other mental and psychological disorders due to its potential to stimulate certain areas of the brain. People use psilocybin for alcohol use disorder and other addictions, anxiety, depression, migraines, PTSD, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses. Psilocybin is illegal under federal law in the US. It is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance.","When taken by mouth : Psilocybin is possibly safe when used as a single dose under medical supervision. Single doses of psilocybin have been used in controlled settings without serious side effects. The most common side effects include confusion, fear, hallucinations, headache, high blood pressure, nausea, and paranoia. Despite being a controlled substance in the US, the risk for abuse seems low. Withdrawal symptoms and physical dependence don't appear to be a major concern. There isn't enough reliable information to know if psilocybin is safe to use without medical supervision at any dose, including micro doses. Special Precautions & Warnings: Pregnancy and breast-feeding : There isn't enough reliable information to know if psilocybin is safe to use when pregnant or breast-feeding.

Heart disease : Psilocybin might increase the risk of cardiac arrest and death in people with heart disease. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) : Psilocybin might make diarrhea worse in people with IBS.","Psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, is known to produce perceptual changes, altering one’s awareness of surroundings, thoughts, and feelings. These effects are exerted primarily via serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) type 2A receptor agonism (30). This functional selectivity to the 5-HT2A receptor leads to releasing increased levels of glutamate, which may also contribute to the psychedelic effects. The visual hallucinations associated with psilocin are likely due to overexpression of 5-HT2A receptors in the visual cortex (31).
Additionally, psilocybin is thought to decrease negative affect and the neural correlates of negative affect, thought to be one of the mechanisms underlying its effects against a variety of mental disorders (32).
Following oral consumption, the bioavailability of psilocin was reported to be approximately 50%, with detectable levels in the plasma after 30 min (33). Recent studies using a 25 mg dose of psilocybin found the onset of action at 20-40 minutes with effects peaking at 60-90 minutes, and active duration between 4-6 hours (34). The Tmax (maximal plasma concentration) was 18.7 ng/ml - 20 ng/ml at 120 minutes (35) (36). Nearly 80% of the circulating psilocin is metabolized by hepatic phase II glucuronidation (conjugation) through UGT 1A10 and UGT 1A9 enzymes.

DSI007858,Scorpion Venom,C0036450,"The scorpion is a predatory arthropod represented by more than 1500 different species worldwide . As part of the diverse arachnid class, scorpions possess a venomous stinger at the end of their tails used to paralyze prey or for self-defense. Although the venom is generally considered poisonous, there are varying degrees of pathogenicity and only a small fraction of scorpion species are deadly to humans . The belief that scorpions have medicinal properties has existed for centuries, and many instances of their use have been recorded in both indigenous and folk medicine. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, the entire scorpion of the Buthus martensii Karsch (BmK) species is used to treat convulsions, spasms, and pain , and some laboratory studies confirm that scorpion venoms do contain antinociceptive properties . Scorpion venom has also been evaluated for other applications. It appears useful in killing intraerythrocytic malarial pathogens without harming the erythrocyte , and some species contain antimicrobial peptides that appear effective against yeast, fungi, bacteria, and viruses . Scorpion venom could also be a source for the isolation of anticancer molecules. Preliminary assessments indicate that Tityus discrepans, Androctonus crassicauda, and Odontobuthus doriae venoms are inducers of apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines . A component in BmK venom inhibits proliferation of human leukemia cells suggesting therapeutic potential in hematopoietic malignancies . Because the general composition and expression level of scorpion venom depends on genetic variations and geographical environments, research to identify the active components that have therapeutic potential across the various species continues . Rhopalurus junceus, or blue scorpion venom, originated from Cuba, and is often marketed as having anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties. Claims for these products, known as Escozine and Escozul, are largely based on anecdotal information, testimonials, and preclinical experiments on laboratory animals. However, the manufacturers’ research cannot be corroborated and has not been published in any peer-reviewed journal . In 2009, the Cuban government formally rejected the use of Escozul due to insufficient clinical data . Only recently has there been a functional characterization of R. junceus in the literature, but without any clinical evidence presented for R. junceus-derived products . A homeopathic version, Vidatox, has since been developed and has also not been evaluated in peer-reviewed journals. The more likely scenario for future benefits with scorpion venom in cancer therapy may come from clinical trials involving chlorotoxin (CTX), a scorpion venom-derived peptide. CTX may facilitate the entry of chemotherapeutic compounds into tumor cells to target drug delivery and improve efficacy . In addition, it holds the potential for reducing side effects and can be synthesized in the laboratory . A synthetic CTX that selectively binds to glioma and other tumors cells is being evaluated as a radiopharmaceutical to deliver therapeutic levels of radiation directly to disease sites . A CTX/near-infrared fluorescent molecule combination is under investigation as a cancer imaging agent, a kind of “tumor paint” that may help surgeons more clearly identify tumor margins and micrometastases, and spare normal tissue . Continued research on the complex characteristics of scorpion venom among the various species is needed to both isolate the properties of therapeutic importance and develop their application in cancer research.",,"The sheer number of compounds and their diverse pharmacologic properties among different scorpion species leaves their mechanisms poorly understood (12) (31). Most scorpion venoms are known to contain peptide toxins that mainly act on ion channels (29). These biologically active peptides are classified as either disulfide-bridged peptides (DBPs) which are mostly responsible for neurotoxic effects, and non-disulfide-bridged (NDBPs) which have been an attractive area of research for their spectrum of biological activities (36).
Hp1036 and Hp1239 peptides are antiviral and exert inhibitory effects throughout the Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) life cycle (37). TsAP-1 and TsAP-2 peptides possess antimicrobial and anticancer activity that can be substantially improved with increased cationicity (38). AcrAP1 and AcrAP2 analogues have also displayed enhanced antimicrobial activity and growth modulation effects on a range of human cancer cell lines (39). Peptides are also being engineered to produce selective therapeutic ion channel inhibitors which may have potential against autoimmune diseases (40). A fusion protein generated from chlorotoxin inhibited matrix metalloproteinase-2 release from pancreatic cancer cells, which require their activation during invasion and migration (41).
The venom from R. junceus was shown to have reversible beta and alpha activities. It enabled sodium channels to open at more negative potentials, delayed inactivation of potassium channels, and rapidly blocked ERG potassium channels in neuroblastoma cells (18). Proteins found in T. discrepans venom bind to FasL and Bcl-2 on the surface of breast cancer cells inducing apoptosis (9). Buthus matensii Karsch (BmK) scorpion venom extracts inhibited human breast cancer cells by inducing apoptosis and blocking cell cycle in G0/G1 phase (42). BmK venom also induces apoptosis in human lymphoma cells by upregulating PTEN, and decreases levels of Akt and Bad phosphorylation, resulting in increased p27 expression (32). Another component of BmK venom inhibits cell proliferation by modulating NF-κB activation in human leukemia cells (12). Bengalin, a high molecular weight protein from the Indian black scorpion induced autophagy in human leukemic cells through ERK-MAPK pathway (43). A. crassicauda and O. doriae venoms induce apoptosis via caspase-3 activity and nuclear DNA fragmentation in neuroblastoma and breast cancer cells (10) (11). Further, the proteolytic enzymes in scorpion venom are likely responsible for its necrotic activity (11). Leiurus quinquestriatus venom contains a chlorotoxin (CTX) associated with MMP2 that increases its affinity for primary brain tumors and reduces the potential for tumor invasion of healthy tissue (20) (21). CTX, which functions as a paralytic in nature, has a molecular structure with a single tyrosine residue available for radioiodination (33). Synthetic CTX has shown antiangiogenic properties and a synergistic effect with bevacizumab in animal models (24) and specifically binds with the protein annexin A2 in diverse tumor cell lines (34).
An array of other components in scorpion venoms may have therapeutic uses. BmK venom has sympathomimetic and analgesic properties (30) (35). It contains a peptide that modulates G-protein-coupled receptor activity, and has a primary structure similar to enkephalin-like peptides (31). Other venoms also exhibit antinociceptive properties which appear to be activated by an endogenous opioid system partly triggered by counterirritation (5).",,Blue scorpion,,,Scorpion Venom,

Mey or Asian Ginseng), Fu Ling (Poria cocos (Schw.) wolf), Bai Zhu (Adactylies macrocephala Koidz Rhizome), Gan Cao (Glycyrrhiza uralensis fisch or Licorice), Bai Bian Dou (Dolichos lablab), Shan Yao (Dioscore opposita thumb), Lian Zi (Nelumbo nucifera), Jie Geng (Platycodon grandifloras (Jacq.) A. DC.), Sha Ren (Amomum villosum Lour.), and Yi Yi Ren (Coix lacryma-jobi L. var. ma-yuen (Roman.) Stapf). Today, SLBZS continues to be used by practitioners in the Asia-Pacific region to manage chronic diarrhea and is the second most prescribed formula for post-surgery colon cancer patients in Taiwan . Clinical data are largely limited to Asian population. A pilot, four-arm, randomized controlled trial of patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS) found SLBZS to be associated with improvements in D-IBS symptoms. In addition, abdominal pain and frequency, discomfort, and stool form showed greater improvements in patients who took SLBZS with or without otilonium bromide, an antispasmodic drug, compared to the otilonium bromide and placebo groups. Notably, patients in the SLBZS and SLBZS + otilonium bromide arms had fewer adverse events compared to those in the otilonium bromide and placebo groups . In patients with ulcerative colitis, both SLBZS and modified SLBZS were found to be more effective than the first-line therapy mesalamine for controlling diarrhea, abdominal pain and fever . A large review found SLBZS to be the second most prescribed formula for ulcerative colitis, citing the need for well-designed studies . This formula was also superior to the quinolone antibiotic norfloxacin for symptom management in patients with chronic diarrhea of unknown etiology . A systematic review and meta-analysis (14 trials, 1158 patients with ulcerative colitis, chronic diarrhea and D-IBS) reported significant improvements in patient-reported satisfaction with SLBZS or SLBZS combined with conventional medicine compared with conventional medicine alone; and pooled analysis of 9 trials showed that SLBZS did not increase the risk of adverse effects compared with controls . Additional methodologically robust trials are needed to bolster the evidence base surrounding SLBZS. Because diarrhea is associated with many gastrointestinal disorders, future studies should also use a global diagnostic code of gastrointestinal disease to yield unambiguous data.",,"Pharmacological studies suggest that SLBZS promotes the integrity of intestinal barrier, regulates inflammatory factors, and modulates gut microbiota by reducing the levels of potential pathogens and increasing those of beneficial bacteria (9)(10) (11) (12).

However, the prescribing information for this product recommends against its use in patients with liver cirrhosis or cancer, or in patients with liver dysfunction/chronic hepatitis and a below-normal platelet count, and further indicates that patients should have a “moderately strong constitution”. In addition, a meta-analysis determined that the efficacy of Sho-saiko-to for chronic hepatitis B is unclear, with small trials of low methodological quality . Because its use is associated with interstitial pneumonitis , liver injuries , and hepatitis , Sho-saiko-to should only be used under the supervision of a qualified practitioner.",,"Preclinical experiments show that Sho-saiko-to may enhance various aspects of immune function including effects on natural killer cells (12), interleukins (9), interferon gamma (10) (18), and macrophages (11) (13). Its regulation of the cytokine production system may help to explain effects on disease progression, as Sho-saiko-to induced IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, while suppressing IL-4 and IL-5 in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures from patients with chronic active hepatitis (9). It is also a mild inducer of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, cytokines that play key roles in biological defense mechanisms (14).
Animal studies suggest Sho-saiko-to may prevent liver fibrosis and preneoplastic lesions by inhibiting stellate cells (7), the activation of which has been identified as a main driver of fibrosis in liver injury (29). Fibrotic inhibition has also been attributed to Nrf2 pathway upregulation against oxidative stress (30). Sho-saiko-to regulates temporal gene expression in mouse hepatocytes by way of microRNA (23).

Future studies are needed to determine the extent to which this herbal remedy may either positively or negatively alter conventional anticancer therapy.",,"A number of ingredients in Tian Xian, including Cordyceps sinensis (Dong Chong Xia Cao), Astragulus membranaceus (Huang Qi), Ganoderma lucidum (Ling Zhi, reishi mushroom), Panax ginseng (Ren Shen), Atractylodes macrocephalae (Bai Zhu), Dioscorea batatas (Shan Yao), Codnopsis pilosula (Dang Shen), Pogostemon cablin (Huo Xiang), Lycium barbarum (Gou Qi Zi), Pteria margaritifera (Pearl Powder), Ligustrum lucidum (Nu Zhen Zi), and Radix glycyrrhizae (Licorice) (2) have various characteristics and activities.
Tian Xian liquid increased proliferation of antigen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and T cells isolated from patients with recurrent aphthous ulcers, likely via increased cytotoxic activity of NK cells, increased phagocytic activity of macrophages, anti-inflammatory effects, and immunopotentiation by the active constituents (1).
In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that Tian Xian activates human pregnane X receptor (PXR), which is involved in the hepatic uptake, metabolism, and elimination of toxic compounds; and alters the strength of PXR protein / transcriptional cofactor protein interactions (10). In humanized PXR mice, Tian Xian increased hepatic CYP3A11 expression and induced CYP3A4 expression, suggesting that combining it with conventional chemotherapeutic agents may be contraindicated (10). In models of human colorectal cancer, Tian Xian inhibits proliferation via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (8), downregulates matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP2) and MMP7 mRNA expression, and increases vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA expression, but not protein levels in vivo (11). It also upregulates p21 protein levels and downregulates MMP1 and multidrug resistance-1 protein levels (12). Suppression of gene expression and tumorigenicity of cancer stem-like hepatoma cells, as well as synergy with doxorubicin also occur through inhibition of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways (7).",,Tian-Xian Liquid | Tien Hsien | Tien-Hsien Liquid,,,Tian Xian,
DSI007867,Triphala,,"Triphala is an herbal formulation used in the Indian medicinal system of Ayurveda . It consists of equal portions of dried and powdered fruits of three medicinal plants: Emblica officinalis (Amalaki), Terminalia chebula (Haritaki) and T. belerica (Bibhitaki) , and may also be combined with guggulu, a tree gum resin, for additional therapeutic effects. Triphala is used to treat dental caries, anemia, jaundice, constipation, asthma, fever, chronic ulcers, inflammation, obesity, and to strengthen the immune system. Preclinical studies using Triphala report antibacterial , anticancer , antiobesity , antiarthritic, anti-inflammatory and hypolipidemic properties . It may also protect against intestinal damage , colitis , and nephrotoxicity . Studies in humans are limited. Data suggest Triphala mouthwash has antibacterial effects and that antiplaque efficacy is comparable to chlorhexidine, but data are not definitive . Furthermore, Triphala may actually promote oral bacterial biofilm formation . Other preliminary data suggest immunostimulatory effects , reversal of oral precancerous lesions , and improved HDL cholesterol and blood sugar levels . However, a double-blind study of Triphala in combination with guggulu showed no benefit on serum cholesterol levels, BMI, or waist circumference .",,"Polyphenolic compounds and flavonoids found in Triphala are thought to be responsible for many of its effects. Gallic acid, a major polyphenol, has antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties (11) (33).
In preclinical studies, Terminalia chebula inhibited hyaluronidase and collagenase to prevent cartilage degradation (7). Antiarthritic and anti-inflammatory effects of Triphala are attributed to NF-kBp65 and COX-2 inhibition (25) (26), whereas the anticolitic effects are attributed to antioxidant properties (22). Nephrotoxic effects were also thought to be attenuated via increased antioxidant activity (23).
Triphala appears to stimulate neutrophil function and decrease corticosterone levels in immunized rats exposed to noise stress (34). It also exerted radioprotective effects (21) by inhibiting oxidative damage. Triphala increased ROS in breast cancer cells resulting in apoptosis (8), protected against X-radiation and bleomycin, both of which generate DNA strand breaks in HeLa cells (42), and appeared to protect mice from radiation-induced mortality (2) (3).
Despite its antibacterial properties, compounds in Triphala may promote the formation of oral bacterial biofilm via activation of glucosyl transferases (30).

DSI007871,Wheat grass,C1455751,"Wheat grass is prepared by sprouting wheat seeds in water for 7–10 days before harvesting the leaves. Because the leaves are fibrous and difficult to digest, the juice from the leaves is extracted and consumed raw. Proponents believe the enzymes responsible for detoxifying the body are deactivated by the cooking process. Wheat grass is also marketed as a nutritional supplement in powder form. Wheat grass juice has been claimed to neutralize toxins and carcinogens in the body, prevent tooth decay, reduce high blood pressure, and aid in the treatment and prevention of cancer and AIDS. It is also used to improve digestion, and for common colds, cough, rheumatic pain, chronic fatigue syndrome, ulcers, and skin conditions. However, none of these claims are supported by clinical studies. Wheat grass proponents also equate its major constituent chlorophyll to hemoglobin, and believe that wheat grass consumption can increase oxygenation in the body. However, these concepts are not supported by current scientific understanding. Animal models suggest that wheat grass may have hypolipidemic and antioxidant effects. Preliminary studies in humans suggest wheat grass supplementation may reduce plasma lipid peroxidation in healthy volunteers engaged in regular exercise or atherogenic lipoproteins in hyperlipidemic women .

DSI007872,Xiao Yao San,C2605266,"Xiao Yao San (XYS) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formula documented in Tai Ping Hui Min He Ji Ju Fang, a collection of prescriptions written during the Song Dynasty around 1078-1085 AD. It consists of eight herbs: Bupleuri radix (Chai Hu), Angelicae radix (Dang Gui or Dong Quai), Paeoniae radix alba (Bai Shao), Atractylodis rhizome macrocephalae (Bai Zhu), Poria cocos (Fu Ling), Zingiberis siccatum rhizome (Sheng Jiang), Menthae haplocalycis (Bo He), and Glycyrrhizae radix (Gan Cao or Licorice). Xiao Yao San has a long history of use as a treatment for depression, anxiety and stress. Accumulating evidence also suggests its potential as a treatment for functional gastrointestinal disorders . A modified version known as Dan Zhi XYS or Jia Wei XYS was developed with two additional herbs with cooling properties: Cortex Moutan (Mu Dan Pi) and Fructus Gardeniae (Zhi Zi). This formulation is used both in China and Japan to manage symptoms such as mood, anxiety, fatigue, and insomnia associated with climacteric syndrome. Jia Wei XYS is also the most prescribed product for breast cancer patients according to the Taiwan health insurance research database . In addition, a large retrospective study found that Jia Wei XYS was frequently utilized (nearly a third of all herbal prescriptions) by breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen. The authors reported notable reductions in the risk of endometrial cancer along with statistically non-significant improvements in tamoxifen-induced side effects . Another study of cervical cancer patients in Taiwan reported reduction in mortality rate and improvement in survival probability with adjunctive use of Jia Wei XYS . This formula has also been positively correlated with reduced risk of dementia . Below are the major symptoms for which XYS and Jia Wei XYS are prescribed along with current clinical evidence. Depression A systematic review of 26 RCTs involving 1,837 depressive patients found that XYS and its modified forms combined with antidepressants (selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclics and tetracyclics) were superior to antidepressants alone. The formulae also improved HAMD scores without increasing the number of adverse events . Another review of 5 XYS studies with 1,260 participants concluded that despite some positive findings, the use of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for depression cannot be fully substantiated . But growing evidence since then suggests otherwise. A meta-analysis of 40 trials, which included 11 XYS studies, with 3,549 participants reported better clinical outcomes with CHM based on HAMD scores. Furthermore, adding CHM to conventional treatments reduced the adverse effects associated with their use; CHM alone also caused fewer adverse events compared with antidepressants . An additional review of 55 studies, which included 12 XYS trials, with 5,572 participants yielded similar findings: CHM with or without SSRIs (fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline) was associated with statistically significant improvements in HAMD scores causing fewer, less severe adverse effects . XYS may also be relevant in cancer settings. In a review of 18 trials, which included 4 XYS studies, and 1,441 gastric, lung, esophageal, breast and liver cancer patients, CHM users had fewer side effects compared to conventional antidepressants. Adverse events included functional gastrointestinal disorders, sleep disturbances, blurred vision, and fatigue. However, the authors did not perform subgroup analysis for the different cancer types or disease stage . Anxiety Both XYS and Jia Wei XYS have been studied for their potential anxiolytic effects. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 9 trials with 681 patients reported that XYS, alone or in combination with conventional medicine, helped improve sleep quality and relieve anxiety . In an 8-week, multi-center trial of 192 patients with mild to moderate depression and anxiety, Jia Wei XYS was comparable to sertraline in improving HAMD, HAMA, and Clinical Global Impression Scale scores with sustained benefits at the 12-week follow-up. Jia Wei XYS was also associated with lower adverse event rate . Insomnia Data show that 40-60% of patients with mood disorders develop insomnia before developing symptoms associated with mood disorders . In the trial described above , the authors reported that in addition to improving anxiety, Jia Wei XYS also affected reductions in symptoms of sleep disorder at the 12-week follow up. Additionally, in patients with psychological stress insomnia, Jia Wei XYS, used alone or in combination with the benzodiazepene estazolam, led to subjective improvements in sleep quality . Although current evidence suggests benefits of both XYS and Jia Wei XYS, majority of the above mentioned studies are limited by small sample size, risk of bias, variations in treatment duration and dosage, and medication compliance. Larger, methodologically-robust trials are needed to generate more definitive data.",,"The mechanisms underlying the biological effects of XYS have yet to be elucidated. Recent findings suggest that it exerts anti-depressant effects by regulating lactic acid, glycerol, glutamine, glutamic acid, hypoxanthine, myo-inositol and cholesterol levels, which are involved in D-glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, arginine biosynthesis as well as alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism (11).",,Free and Easy Wanderer | Rambling Powder | Jia Wei Xiao Yao San | Dan Zhi Xiao Yao San | Augmented rambling powder | Kamishoyosan | TJ-24,,,Xiao Yao San,

In the last few decades, the trade name YNBY has been expanded into a product line that includes pills, tinctures, and toothpaste. The original formula is believed to contain multiple herbs with notoginseng as the main ingredient. It is also promoted as a dietary supplement that can be used both externally and internally to stop bleeding and to treat cancer in humans and in animals. Other claims include relief from minor aches and pains associated with backache, arthritis, strains, bruises, and sprains . In vitro and animal studies suggest YNBY and notoginseng have hemostatic , anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. Notoginseng by itself demonstrated anticoagulant, antiplatelet , and fibrinolytic activities. Clinical studies suggest that YNBY may help treat uterine hemorrhage, ulcerative colitis and skin ulcers . Other preliminary data suggest topical application of a yunnan baiyao paste may reduce hospital-acquired pressure ulcers . It also reduced intraoperative blood loss during prostate and oral surgery . Case reports suggest that adjunctive topical YNBY may reduce bleeding in cancer patients , but it has not been studied as a cancer treatment. Ginsenosides derived from notoginseng may exert estrogenic effects and stimulate growth of hormone-sensitive breast cancer cells .",,"YNBY demonstrates hemostatic effects when applied topically on open wounds (2). Microscopic examination identified nanofiber components which may help activate blood clotting, act as scaffolding for tissue repair, and prevent infection by wound sealing (4). Preclinical studies suggest anti-inflammatory activity may occur through lymphocyte suppression and proinflammatory cytokine expression (11) and modulation of COX and LOX pathways (30). YNBY extract may also activate intracellular prostaglandin E(2) and thromboxane B(2) in osteoblasts (8).
Anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects by notoginseng may occur via fibrinogen reduction (6) (7). Notoginseng also protected endothelial function and vascular integrity by regulating focal adhesion kinase, integrin expression and NF-kappa B functions (19) (20), and inhibited vascular intimal hyperplasia by lowering expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, cyclinE, cyclinD1, FN and MMP-9. (21). Antimicrobial activity has been suggested in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa model, wherein a water extract of YNBY reduced bacterial virulence by affecting quorum-sensing signaling and reducing biofilm formation (5).
In other studies, notoginsenoside Ft1, a saponin constituent, induced platelet aggregation by binding to platelet P2Y12 receptors (3). It demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting neutrophil function and NO and PGE2 production through reduced iNOS and COX-2 expression (10). In peritoneal macrophages, notoginseng had a bidirectional regulatory effect, inhibiting COX-2 expression at an early stage and elevating it at a later stage (22). Data also suggest it can inhibit expression of NF-kappaB activity and TNF-alpha mRNA (12). Notoginseng may play a role in periodontal disease treatment by suppressing MMP-2 expression and by inhibiting breakdown of bone tissue (9). In another study, Ginsenoside-Rd isolated from notoginseng reduced atherosclerosis by inhibiting LDL uptake and cholesterol accumulation in macrophages (23).
Some studies report that notoginseng and constituent ginsenosides mimic estrogen (16) by binding and activating the estrogen receptor (18) and ER-alpha pathway (17).

It also reduced androgen receptor signaling and enhanced bicalutamide-induced apoptosis (9). Other studies in prostate cancer cell lines suggest that Zyflamend inhibits class I and class II histone deacetylase expression, upregulates p21 expression (13), and regulates upstream kinases LKB1 and CaMKK2 via AMPK activation (14).
In melanoma cells, Zyflamend induced autophagy and apoptosis sequentially by activating the intrinsic caspase cascade. Cell migration and COX-2 expression were also suppressed (5). It also inhibited NF-kappa B activation in myeloid leukemia, lung adenocarcinoma (2), pancreatic (4), and cisplatin-resistant bladder cancer cells (15). In leukoplakia and skin cell lines, both Zyflamend and carnosol, an antioxidant phenolic constituent, inhibited mutagenesis via Hsp90 ATPase inhibition, which led to reduced aryl hydrocarbon receptor levels and CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 suppression (12).
Both a cellular model of obesity-related inflammation and an obese animal model indicate that Zyflamend blocks proinflammatory mediators and aromatase induction as well as Akt and NF-kB activation. Increased aromatase mRNA levels and mammary gland activity were also partially inhibited (7). Reduction of adiposity was attributed to AMPK activation (16).
In a murine xenograft model of prostate cancer, Zyflamend inhibited androgen-dependent tumor growth and histone deacetylase-5, biomarkers linked to prostate cancer progression (6). It also reduced the number of inflammatory cells, hyperplasia and dysplasia, and tumor incidence and number, and inhibited cell proliferation in an animal model of oral squamous cell carcinoma (3).",,Zyflamend,,,Zyflamend,
